the first time i was an undergraduate english major at the university of oklahoma professor invited me to private office hours touched my leg commented on my body it happened again when i was a student worker in the library custodian stalked me and then as an english grad student at the university of idaho faculty member in my department put his hand between my legs at a party faculty member in my field one of two repeatedly pursued me touched me cornered me this last one is the one ill write about here
i received less of a raise than my married coworkers with kids because i was single and childless my supervisor admitted it but nothing changed
intimidated by sports coach i was in the school weight machine room and watched a school coach get really close and make inappropriate comments to university female students he was training this was back in the late s early s i dont remember exactly what he said i mentioned to a young woman working out next to me she didnt seem to be part of that group the coach was training that i didnt like the way he spoke to the women next time i went to the gym the coach menacingly cornered me saying i hear youve been saying things about me and im not going to have that i answered with my pulse racing at unimaginable speed and with the most clueless expression i could muster i have absolutely no idea what you are talking about he looked at me hesitatingly for what seemed an eternity probably just a few seconds and walked away but warned me to watch what i said i never reported this incident to anybody for reasons i stated above
intermittent inappropriate comments whether on outfit or marital status combined with total disengagement with me as an intellectual public hostility and criticism without even pretending to read my work patronizing and insulting in front of graduate students
i was working in a research lab in for a tenured professoran older male and a selfproclaimed maverick and wellrespected pioneer in his field i also came to learn quickly that he was temperamental verbally abusive to others in the lab and prone to outbursts the morning of the labs holiday party he threw one of his legendary verbal tantrums and i happened to be the target i was furious that afternoon at the party still enraged i simply ignored him i refused to engage with him or even look in his direction but i could see in my peripheral vision that he kept looking across the crowded room over in my direction trying to catch my eye i continued to stare straight ahead he walked toward me in my direction and i continued to stare straight ahead and then walked behind me slowly dragging his knuckles across my backside as he passed he said nothing all these years ive been embarrassed that i did nothing in response i didnt call him out on it i didnt report it i told no one at the time for fear i would lose my job my health insurance and prospects for future jobs i also knew it was a he said she said situation and i believed a tenured professors word would trump an employees word
during our diciplines annual conference i was staying in small hotel within walking distance of the venue so was another very famous older white male professor from my specialization and from my university after chatting with other hotel guests in the lobby one night because yes it is quite common to meet other conference goers at your same accommodation place this old white male professor starting chatting with me and hen proceeding to hit on me and try to diss out if he could go further i immediately shut him down because i was uncomfortable in the years since i only told one female friend immediately after and one other person since besides therapists etc what was so emotionally traumatic was that he felt he could come on to me that it would be okay and that he knew i wouldnt couldnt say anything and that overwhelmingly i felt like i was treated as a sexual object and not a colleague in the field of expertise my value as a female body was more than the value of my intellectual contributions the following year this man apologized to me i told him that it was not okay but lets move forward then in the same breath he was suggestive again i ended up leaving the conference session and since then have not renewed my membership with the speciality section because of the goodolboy treatment of women in the field
in when i was a first year student in the law school at columbia university i was repeatedly harassed by a female student who made it clear that her only interest in me was my penis i reported these incidents to the dean of students but no action was taken

i was a student assistant in the department of a hot shot professor at the time president of the national association of our field he and his team of all male research assistants would sexualize any conversation continuous stream of comments on my looks or those of other female students and how much they would like to fuck them no interaction with any of them was impossible without drawing comments like oh she must really have the hots for you if she is talking to you again one of the research assistants shared his sexual fantasy involving one of the other female student assistens with the group over lunch the professor had continuous affairs with several other students which he would even invite to the departmental summer party hosted by his wife he would ask me to fetch something from his desk so i had to look at the pornographic films that were still running on his desk monitor i was continously questioned for details of my sex life and that of others
i was drugged and raped by a professor in my department at the beginning of this semester
the person doing the language checking of my ms left inappropriate comments in the margin which i of course had to read since they could not be differentiated from the valid comments except by reading them
a tenured faculty member in the social sciences created an extremely hostile work environment for me while i was a tenuretrack assistant professor he constantly engaged in highly inappropriate behavior including graphic discussions about sex pornography and his own fantasies about raping various women he was obsessed with any new woman who was hired on the faculty and he repeated this pattern with me and others including attempts to insinuate himself into my personal life and attempts to alienate me from other colleagues with lies and other manipulative behavior he thrived on his attempts to gas light me and various other women including faculty staff and students he practically lived on campus there all hours of the day and night seven days a week it was impossible to avoid him on such a small campus he was a popular and charismatic instructor and made sure you knew of his power on campus because of it this man is a serial predator and abuser after i left i heard from former students who had horrific stories to tell about how he had abused them many offenses for which he should be terminated all asked me to keep their confidence and i have but it is an awful burden to bear
shortly after i arrived in my new job as a single woman a married senior colleague started treating me like a very close friend presuming i would have weekly lunches with him soon that turned into treating me like his girlfriend insisting on taking me to dinner alone on special occasions buying me flowers and gifts and complimenting me on my appearance then he told me his friends were calling me his girlfriend once on the way to a dinner that he was buying me he pressed against me on public transportation i was pretenure and had many years of uncertainty ahead so i never reported anything but i told my friends from grad school and one of them kept a record for me just in case eventually i slowly distanced myself from him and of course offended him in the process
i was told by a student in one of my classes that women should e pregnant barefoot and behind the stove i was teaching an introductory it course i was in my second year of teaching that student is now an instructor at same college
i attended an mfa program in writing where harassment of female students was rampant it wasnt helped by other students who would assume that if a student was being hit on by a given faculty member that she must have been sleeping with him i personally experienced harassment from a number of faculty members but the most problematic was from the director who attempted to kiss me on the mouth
chair of search committee for tt job in the department in which i was doing a postdoc
i was raped assaulted and stalked
between this happened a lot with one particular fellow student peer and poet who is now a prominent literary critic in canada it began when he showed interest in helping me improve my writing although married he invited me out for coffee to discuss my writing and tell me how i could fix it he did not look at my work beyond a line or two but he flirted heavily with me and proceeded to explain to me what was wrong with womens poetry i have heard that he did this coffee invitation thing to a lot of women poets
during the visit weekend for accepted students i met a tenured faculty member who upon learning of my research interests mentioned a dataset he had that i could use for a project this was my first interaction with him and it seemed ultimately quite positive later that evening was a dinner at this professors home for current and admitted graduate students and faculty at one point he came up to me in the kitchen and began asking me if i had read a recently published magazine article about how women were entering into casual sexual relationships so they could focus on their careers this had absolutely nothing to do with my research interests or our previous conversations and my gut instincts told me he was trying to hit on me or test some kind of boundary i felt panicked and didnt know how to respond especially since he had offered that research opportunity to me earlier as a defense mechanism i tried to exit the conversation as quickly as possible and tried to hide how upset i felt a female junior faculty member was close by and i believe heard the entire thing but did not step in at all i clearly remember her giving me a look as though i was the one who encouraged it and she didnt followup with me or anything i left the room as soon as i could and immediately told a few other admitted students who shared my alarm i never told anyone in the department because i didnt know any faculty well enough to bring it up and i also was worried it would make me look bad or ruin potential professional connections i ultimately decided not to go to that program because of this encounter even though this was the highest ranked program i got into i later found out from other women that they had similar encounters with this particular faculty member
i was a grad student taking classes at a biological field station in two female students were assaulted by the same individual that summer one was reported to the station director immediately the other was not reported until the following year rather than acting as a mandatory reporter the response of the station director to the delayed report was to contact multiple other students that were on site at the time to inquire if they remember if the interaction was consensual or not
i worked for my undergrad advisor in the lab and at a remote field camp while i was his student and after i graduated as his technician he would do inappropriate things that i imagine were intended as flirting once he put my sweaty field shirt on his head huffed it and said in a suggestive way that it smelled like me send inappropriate emails for example he sent me a picture of a penis though not his own as far as i know say inappropriate things once he said that if i wanted help with something then i should come by his office in a dress and makeup and try asking him for whatever it was and occasionally tried inappropriate things like reaching across the breakfast table to put his hands on mine he offered to help me publish research papers he explained that this was the missing piece to my being a very strong grad applicant he was the first academic to show interest in helping me build my career i had a long term partner and felt that since i set strong clear boundaries i could handle his odd behavior after i graduated i worked for a grad student in the same department but a different lab my grandfather got ill and i left that field job early to come home the grad student for whom i was working did not take the news well and was upset that i was leaving the project early when the professor found out he threatened to ruin my career despite this mans odd behavior i had considered him a friend and mentor and i was really upset that he completely turned on me
a faculty advisors collaborator from another institution publicly hit on multiple female students at conferences insinuating that they would receive professional benefits should they engage with him
postdoc in a lab talked about me and other women in our lab as sexual objects always behind our backs and often to our face statements like grad student x is okay but i mean shes so not feminine i would never sleep with her were common and it almost felt like he said it so that it would pit us against each other he would make comments about my outfits and my body often there was a lab get together where we were at a bar for happy hour he ran into some friends who were leaving the country the next day and he suggested in front of the group that i sleep with his friend as a goodbye gift when i uncomfortably said no he started to laugh with his friends that i was uptight and i need to relax he was considered a charming funny well liked smart guy and i was so insecure with myself that i was drawn to him i became friendly with one of his friends and his friend ended up raping me i never told anyone because i thought it was my fault
i signed up for an independent study after lack of enrollment cancelled an advanced class the professors office was in a locked facility due to the presence of specialized equipment he scheduled our meetings to be after the normal work day no one else was around no one could get in he had a minifridge he kept stocked with beer and had always started drinking before i arrived he pressured me to drink with him pressured me to drink faster id prepare questions about the material he would tell me stories about past exploits with famous people in the field and make sexual innuendos about the one prominent female scientist implying past relations with her when i tried to redirect or end the meeting he would imply that only unintelligent or lazy people would want to talk about that or end the meeting so early the first several meetings ran nearly three hours he would finally let me go once it became obvious that i was never going to relax he would go pee in the sink of the adjoining wet lab space that was feet away from his desk rather than end these meeting there was a line of sight and could hear him relieve himself i would finally be dismissed around or pm the guy was a genius professor and i was some idiot graduate student i minimized the number of meetings read every book i could find on the topic wrote a page paper about the aspect of the technique that interested me the most turned it in by the end of the semester and hoped the whole thing would go away i made sure not another female student crossed the doorway of that facility for the entire time i was at that institute
undergrad senior year i was taking an independent study with a professor i trusted an admired one day he stopped me while i was in the middle of presenting a paper to comment on the length of my eye lashes and occasionally he would make comments on the clothes i was wearing he also told me at one point that i was too pretty to be taken seriously i am fairly certain that he thought he was being helpful somehow by telling me this
during my quals year i tad for a male professor along with two other members of my cohort one man and one woman throughout the semester the male ta repeatedly made jokes in front of our professor and students about how i and the other female ta were unqualified to teach knew nothing about the subject matter of the class would fail our quals were overly emotional or stupid etc our professor never joined in on the joking and otherwise was very respectful to me and the other female ta and gave us stellar teaching evaluations but he also to my deep disappointment never reprimanded the male ta for this behavior
senior scholar in the field complimented my work and invited me for a drink to thank me for a positive review i wrote about his book he groped and continuously tried to kiss me in the bar he later wrote me an email giving me professional advice that i didnt ask enough questions about his work during our meeting a year later he apologized and still apologized nearly every time i see him about once a year at major conferences
in at the aag large disciplinary conference a professor not sure of rank but more than twice my age cornered me at my poster to tell me his sexual fetishes
on of my good school professors always commented on my appearance if i dressed up he regularly hit on female students and made them feel uncomfortable he clearly favored students he considered more attractive allowing them more opportunities to advance their scholarship the worst part wa s how he treated my best friend he could often ask her to do his work for him given that he was her advisor and had a lot of power over her career and research trajectory he would her into his office in private and use that as an opportunity to ask her to be physically intimate with him or touch her or invade her personal space inappropriately of all the female grad students he only took it that far with her and while at this point it is pure speculation on my part it seemed he was taking advantage of the fact that she was quiet and reserved and infrequently socialized with others in her cohort the worst part about this is that others who in similar situations would speak us agains such transgressions dismissed his behavior as simply a product of his upbringing in a different country combined with a bit of senility as he was close to retiring these same students who turned a blind eye to this situation are now advocates for calling out sexual harrassers in academia and successful in their careers while the victim chose to leave and start all over again in a very different career path
at a major conference in my field the first time i attended i was at the opening reception i didnt know many people but was introducing myself whenever possible i took a break in between conversations in a corner to regroup observe the room and see if i could spot my colleagues i couldnt while i was standing there an older gentleman looked at me i nodded and returned to watching the room and he walked over and engaged me in conversation at first it was the usualwhat do you research whats your paper on etc but then he said he couldnt hear me he put his hand in the small of my back and tried to draw me closer so he could hear better i stepped firmly backward but he tried to continue the conversation very quickly two colleagues the president of the organization and someone i later realized was my seminar leader stepped in to our conversation engaged him and drew me away i was so grateful in the days after my seminar leader told me that he had a reputation for that kind of behavior and for bullying his female colleagues which i saw play out he and i were then in the same seminar my advisor back home who was once on the organizations advisory board also told me that the leaders knew about his behavior and were trying to figure out what to do and develop a statement of policy on sexual harassment i have no idea if hell be back again this year
approached by a very senior academic at the faculty christmas party you are the most beautiful woman here but why are you wearing that fucking ugly dress proceeded to tell me about his sexual problems with his wife told me that if i wanted to be sure to pass my phd i should just fuck him gestures to my another senior academic
i was in a summer program and my roommate was a female high school senior she left the program after a graduate student took her on a car ride where he was driving and she couldnt get out and told her about what he wanted in a wife and how lonely he was i reported his behavior and he then found me in a parking lot late at night when i was walking back to the dorm alone to yell at me and tell me i was ruining his career and how he hadnt done anything and threaten that if i didnt recant what i said i would regret it when i didnt back down and was entirely ready to engage in a physical altercation he stormed off instead
i went on a date with a male friend i had been talking to for a few weeks he was a new fraternity initiate and we went together to the celebratory frat party after drinking for awhile he asked if i wanted to go somewhere more private he lead me back into a large storage room cement floor bare wooden shelves used for storage and then got a sleeping bag for us to sit on we talk for a bit then he asks for sex i find it appalling he thought we were going to have sex there told him so i made it clear that wasnt going to happen he complained for awhile and then pleaded for me to at least give him a blowjob also no we walked home separately the next day he sends me angry text messages about how im an ungrateful bitch who wont put out for him etc rude comments angry looks whenever i would see him around i replied explaining why he was an asshole
when i joined my advisors lab i quickly noticed that i was being treated differently from my other male colleagues i was often asked to make copies go pick up coffee and other secretarial duties then it progressed to comments on my attire and long nights alone spent in his office because i required according to my advisor extra attention from there the conversations escalated to questions on my sexual preferences and needs and casual touching of the shoulder hand or thigh if i avoided the conversations or tried to leave the situation i was accused of not taking my work seriously this was the first time i reported him i was told that to make a formal accusation would mean i would lose the time and work i had put in and would have to leave the program we were encouraged to hug it out and work out our differences this was fuel for the fire after my first report things moved quickly soon after i was raped and felt stuck in an abusive environment i did everything i could to graduate as quickly as possible and start a new job away from my abuser but it took years to actually break free
women on campus decided to form a chapter of the aauw as a first step in dealing with rampant gender discrimation on our campus a number of men on campus called the group the angry association of university women as a way of dismissing the groups concerns this was one of the first signs i recieved on campus that there were going to be a number of incidents ahead since then the list has been enormous and the instition continues to ignore the issues

various incidents at conferences one guy got angry with me when i wouldnt have sex with him after we had a friendly drink together another walked with me to my room when i went to get cigarettes and tried to kiss me even though id told him before that i wasnt interested in him being in a private space like that when it happened was really worrying and i was very drunk so it was doubly creepy another was an older male prof drinking from my glass and not giving me enough personal space at conference drinks
my advisor constantly tried to sleep with me and he constantly told me he loved me i never slept with him and i never said i loved him he got made at me every time i refused to do those things he interpreted my rejection of his affection as an indication that i was not a good student and was not passionate about the research that we did together
i went to office hours and the professor explained his admitted misogyny by describing how when he was a student posing in the nude to earn money women art students spread their legs to encourage him to embarrass himself by having an erection
too many to detail here years ago the first incident was when my dept chair handed me a folded flyer before a meeting it was an ad for poledancing lessons and the chair told me in case this academic thing doesnt work out for you heres an alternative career option
a very well respected internationally known senior faculty member propositioned me at a conference and offered me money for sex we were at a reception that was being held on a boat so i had no way to leave for several hours after the incident
postcolonial studies professor in my department english introduced me to another student as the graduate student i would most likely have an affair with
i was coerced into sexual activity with a male professor and mentor earlier this fall the incident occurred on campus i learned the next day that this professor had an sti which i may have contracted
a tenured professor in the department regularly made sexual comments to female students usually in the form of narrating his own sex life but often in the form of flirtation other female grad students dismissed my assertion that this was inappropriate saying things like oh he just has issues with boundaries or oh thats just firstname
as an older male professor handed a paoer back to me he winked and said youre feisty and i like it
as a young graduate student i had to fend off a respected academic who was very handsy at a conference dinner and repeatedly tried to grope me when i mentioned this to a wellknown professor who was organising the conference she said oh poor man he gets lonely i was thrown into him again at a conference a few years later and he wouldnt take no for an answer so in the end i had to call a friend to come and pretend to be my boyfriend currently i work in a department where the head of school has taken to randomly asking young female members of staff if people have ever masturbated in front of them
i was taking a class for my major and this guy who i met in the class would always sit by me he was friendly and would chat and we would sometimes meet in the library and do homework after the first month he stopped sitting by me and stopped wanting to work on homework together i didnt think anything of it until a year later when we were both at a party together together and he said i was beautiful and he really wanted to sleep with me but i was a very cold person who wasnt interested in him so he thought his chances would be better with another woman in the class i was really hurt that he only wants to be friends and do homework together because he thought it would improve his chances of sleeping with me is that all i am someone for fellow males in the field to sleep with am i only useful because im a woman do people even care about my science
during my first year of graduate school i was getting drinks with all the other first year graduate students at the student union i was wearing a skirt and sitting around the table with everyone else when one of the other graduate students put his hand on my leg i move my leg away from him and moments later he put his hand on my leg again and quickly moved his hand up towards my crotch i quickly jumped up and moved away from him when i told others they shrugged it off from that day forth i refused to be alone with him and changed plans to avoid being near him that was the most direct situation not to mention the number of times i had to hear my fellow tas and graduate students talk crudely about women or tell sexist jokes
this happened during a job talk i was brought out to the campus to give a talk for a tenuretrack position during the ride from the airport to my hotel room the chair of the search committee a white man decided to tell me a vietnamese woman that his neighborhood was diversifying by diversification he meant that that there was a new vietnamese massage salon spa that opened up next to his building during the candidates dinner he brought the topic of massages back up to me and in front of other colleagues unrelated to any other conversation we were having at dinner he said that he had received a thai massage once and by two thai women these two women he said were small but so strong one apparently massaged the top half of his body the other massaged the second half of his body i looked around for an intervention but none took place instead he preceded to ask if this was my experience with massages i lamely said no i only get massages at burke williams which ive never done before in my life
as an undergraduate i took several classes with a professor who taught on a topic i enjoyed he regularly gave me positive feedback on my work at some point i asked him to become my advisor at some point in my senior year we went out to lunch at the end of lunch he told me his wife was out of town and asked if i wanted to come home with him for a martini it was the middle of the day on a weekday over the years i think i began to discount that memory or my interpretation of it surely this full professor had not basically propositioned me when i was in college i must have misremembered or imagined it years later as a postdoc i ran into him at a conference that was being hosted at his institution he had moved since i completed my undergrad we briefly said hello nothing more later when i landed a tt job he reached out via email to congratulate me and asked if i would be at a large conference that year i was planning to attend and was flattered that he was following my career i agreed to have dinner with him at the conference we had dinner and talked a great deal about my career trajectory he talked about his wife and i talked about my partner of at that time or years so there was no misunderstanding that we were both in committed relationships after dinner he asked me up to his hotel room which i politely declined as we said goodnight he acted as if he would kiss me on the cheek at the last second he turned and kissed me full on the mouth instead
aggressively hit on kissed and held tightly against my will despite protests by a very senior colleague at a conference
i was approached at multiple meetings when nobody else was present elevator walking back to hotel after a dinner in one case the person tried to kiss me in another i was propositioned for a sexual encounter and affair
in the middle of a class discussion on early th century sociology the professor proclaimed to the entire class that i was sexy despite my being older than the rest of the students this prof revels in his academic rebel persona and enjoys making outrageous heavyhanded and unpc remarks often calling out students and engaging them in silly ridiculous conversation related to some personal characteristic name state or country of origin family status religion hobbies etc usually its all in good fun but slightly uncomfortable awkward this was the first time in this class however he made a comment toward anyone that was sexual in nature i was so shocked that i gasped and laughed in surprise but after the shock passed really resented that he verbalized the idea that im some hottie latina milf i believe the professor actually thought he was complimenting me however now i always wonder what other students faculty think of me and whether my intellectual credibility is overshadowed by my appearance ethnicity i feel i constantly have to overcompensate intellectually while repressing personal expression to counteract any stereotypes that were raised reinforced by that comment its exhausting
i was and a junior at a coed private research university eager to do my best so i could get into a top graduate school a full professor in my field invited me to have tea on a sunday afternoon at his apartment to talk about my preliminary research for my senior thesis project we sat down on the couch and he served me a bizarre strong liqueur that i didnt drink suddenly in the middle of our conversation he threw himself on top of me kissing me even as i squirmed away he groped me tried to push himself into my underwear under my skirts and kept trying to frenchkiss me as he attempted to undress me somehow i managed to push him off me he then cried and said he was lonely and begged me to stay to eat something i was terrified hed badname me to my other professors in the department so i stayed the meal was almost worse than the groping for two hours he didnt ask me anything about my research or give me any real advice but instead made me listen to his problems with his relationships divorce etc after that day he made no effort to find out how my research on my senior thesis was progressingor even if i had found someone else to supervise my project
it was i was and just a few weeks into my studies at a respected art college after having transferred there from a liberal art school a professor from a different department noticed me in the copy room a few times where we would make small talk while waiting for copies one day i mentioned to him that i wanted to get into the field of childrens book publishing and illustration and he suggested that we go out for dinner sometime to talk about that since he had experience with publishing he made it sound like it would be a professional meeting related to my goals later at dinner with him it became clear to me that he thought this was a date which i would have never agreed to had i known what his intentions were he never brought up writing publishing books art or my goal of being a picture book author illustrator which had been the entire point of the meeting instead he only asked me questions about my personal life i felt uncomfortable about this and when he drove me back to the dorms at the end of the evening he parked the car and then leaned in to kiss me i recoiled just before he could and when he noticed how uncomfortable i was he tried to pass off his physical advance as just going in for a hug what i just wanted to embrace you he said i awkwardly got out of the car went up to my dorm room and called my boyfriend i was extremely shaken and upset the professor tried calling me while i was on the phone with my boyfriend but i did not pick up he did not approach me again and i avoided him for the remainder of my time at that school i never told anyone at my school about this
sought mentorship and support from a male professor who i admired initially i was thrilled that he took an interest in showing me the ropes of academia because i was in my early phd program years and my faculty advisor was on sabbatical the questions and discussion on postphd program plans slowly lead to his commentary and questions on my dating life and hints at who i was intimate with my appearance my plans for marriage and children hinting at me getting older and getting on with the process asap this carried on for years the inquiries of my dating life came sporadically but when they did they were very intrusive with an underlying tone of questioning who i was intimate with some other extremely uncomfortable exchanges happened with him showing up to events that were student only gatherings that he happened to serendipitously come upon questioning me about dating a fellow classmate and asking if my relationship with my classmate was intimate i refused to answer and he insisted that i tell him l i received an invitation to a social outing which i interpreted as a date and i froze i was scared and appalled that this confirmed my fears that he may be interested in me but i was too scared to tell him he had crossed the line not knowing what could come of it i immediately distanced myself when possible i avoided meetings where i knew he would be or i would arrive a bit late so that i would be able to pick a seat away from him i started missing meetings or shying away from certain conference activities to avoid him the final day that i was a student he came to sit next to me to congratulate me and touched my leg above my knee i sat there motionless glad that it would soon be over because i was done and i would never come back or have to deal with him getting too close to me or touching me or commenting on my looks ever again though i admire his work and respected him as a scholar he absolutely used his power to intimidate me i tried to stand up to him once and he reminded me that i was not his equal
not directly related to me but male students in my phd cohort decided as a group to look up the newly admitted students and preceded to judge each of the new female admits appearances based on the pictures they could find of each of the women on social media this is just one of many similar experiences additionally one of my friends in the department was locked in a room and forced to listen as a colleague described all of his sexual exploits to her despite her requests that he stop
i was sexually assaulted by my ma thesis former diss chair in just after my second year in grad school forced to perform oral sex in my advisors offices as well as in offices he had given to me and other graduate students working on his grants worst time occurred in an office he had assigned to a fellow graduate student i was so ashamed that i begged to be taken elsewhere my advisor took me to his car and continued this enforced oral sex on the roof of a campus parking structure i again begged to go elsewhere my advisor then drove around the roads right around campus forcing me to continue oral sex while we drove until we almost got into an accident he then dropped me off at my church choir rehearsal i felt paralyzed and unable to move my arm wouldnt work to open the door it was as if i had had a stroke this was repeated multiple times in the enusing year the year i was ostensibly getting ready for my qualifying exams when he would drive me home once he drove me to a remote canyon and forced me to do the same two times this practice was nearly stopped by others by an old lady with a flashlight and a police officer who rapped on the window but i did not resist i dissociated instead my abuser called these events a cancer on our relationship and tried successfully for many years to convince me that this was my doing
every meeting the professor our employer would place his hand somewhere on my colleagues lower body like hed rub her thigh or hold her hand and these were only the public instances and ones that i saw he regularly hires something like ten to twenty ras so there were a lot of people in the room too

on my second day of class in my first year of seminary a professor invited me into his office after class he asked me a series of personal questions under the guise of offering spiritual direction he asked explicitly about my divorce and current marital status then raised his eyebrows and informed me that i certainly could be remarried by now his class lectures frequently revolved around sex which was unusual for a class in christian church history he would say inappropriate things to the female students one day he asked about what we think when a hunk walks by he would also make objectifying statements about women when i complained about it he would tell me that some feminist theologians think that we need to be talking about push up bras and sexuality he never respected me as a theologian and made clear his amusement of me particularly when a male classmate made a disparaging remark towards me my classmates look up to him and he has a good reputation in the community as a pastor he claims to be a womens advocate i doubted my own experiences until he finally commented on my slinky dress i was wearing a modest sleeveless blouse behind a podium in a photo of me at a public speaking event at a local church he also made fun of a mutual friend and colleague because i had expressed admiration for him as a chaplain which is the field im preparing for he would encourage us to speak up and then remind us that the faculty have so much power over grades and professional academic recommendations

during the reception after a job talk the candidate joined a conversation i was having with graduate colleagues the candidate said i had asked a really hard question during the q a commented appreciatively on the similarity of our research and proceeded to keep his arm on my shoulder for what i remember to be several minutes it made me extremely uncomfortable as i had never ever been touched in any way by a professor before
he was emotionally abusive in a lot of genderspecific ways but there was only one time it shaded over into the sexually creepy when i came back from a research trip abroad and was showing him pictures of the sites i visited one photo had me in it next to some important ancient thingummy or another he said not looking at me but at my breasts in the photo well the food in foreign land must have been really good it looks like you put on some weight there
i was grabbed by a male student in a movement class not sexually with no advanced warning and with such force that it reactivated a previous injury and i was in pain for days he apparently needed help getting up although hed gotten up from the floor without assistance every week and we were about weeks into the semester at this point he grabbed my shoulder from behind and put his full body weight on it like i was a piece of furniture
early s while meeting in his office just the two of us over the weekend to go over some research results he confessed he finds me attractive he also stated on this as well as several other occasions that he would make a move if he was not married had children i did not know how to respond and overall tried to ignore the situation

in my senior thesis adviser took me to dinner as a debrief review of the project at the time i was very close to this man and believed him to be my mentor at dinner i ordered a martini he heavily encouraged me to have more than oneat one point even ordering one for me after dinner he drove to a park where he held me and tried to kiss me i told him i wanted to go home instead of taking me to my apartment he drove straight to his house he wanted to slow dance and grope me and smoke weed when i said i wanted to leave he said he couldnt drive and then told me i could lie down i went into the bedroom without him and shut the door to try to think of how to get out of this house he entered and grabbed me saying i love you like a daughter like a lover i dont know what i reiterated i wanted to leave i felt extreme pressure since at the time my thesis grade was still out and this man was solely responsible for that grade finally he took me homeafter i said i was leaving my plan was just to run until i was far enough and could call someone i was supposed to meet some friends two hours before i arrived homethey were worried about me the next day he gave me a presenta graduation gift and told me in writing he was sorry just sorry when i didnt respond he resent the card changing the message to say sorry just sorry parting is such sweet sorrow romeo and juliet
i was taking a french class and i was totally lost so i would always ask my professor for help we would joke about pronunciations and grammar i would get wrong but nothing ever outside the topic of french after a few times talking to him i guess he felt comfortable enough to tell me how another female student had reported him for sexual harassment i listened but thought nothing of it other than him just venting later i was the last one to finish taking a test and i would always chew gum and blow bubbles when i would take tests he told me he liked how i did that thing with the gum and it made my mouth look good and how if i kept doing it i would have no trouble from other male professors giving me good grades i laughed nervously and left never asking him for help again

this is just the worst of several harassers during that degree from to a classmate slowly morphed into a cyberstalker some of the lowlights included discovering that he had programmed a tracking app that checked every minutes whether i was logged in and in what room which explained why he always seemed to show up wanting attention as soon as i arrived at work the time he insisted that i really meant yes even though i was repeatedly shouting no because some guy had once told him that erect nipples indicate arousal it was a hot saturday afternoon and id briefly gone into the airconditioned office to grab something while wearing a tank top so he wouldnt stop hugging me the other time he wouldnt stop hugging me and i had to pour my drink down his back to get him to back off the time he physically blocked me from leaving his apartment insisting i had to sleep there then after i tricked him into complacency by pretending to give in and made a run for the door he threatened to throw himself over the banister of the very steep staircase if i didnt stop i did finally convince him to let me leave and finally after i cut off all contact stopped answering my office phone and told others in my lab not to let him in he hacked into my email so that he received a copy of all of my incoming mail for months then unsatisfied with only getting incoming mail not outgoing mail tried to hack further into the system and finally got caught by the sys admins
after a lot of hard work and dedication i got my dream job the university is a perfect fit and i am excelling in both teaching and research however most days when i come to work a senior faculty member comments on how i look my clothes my skirt the shoes i wear and how they flatter my figure in some way he even has gone as far as to say maybe i should stop saying this because it could be harassment these comments insinuate that my value is in the way i look and not in the way i conduct myself in the classroom or in my research they make me feel small and self conscious and have lead to me avoiding department gatherings and informal events
an unmarried prof in a graduate program at a large state university invited female grad students to come individually to his apartment for a glass of wine after the last class but before grades were turned in for the alleged purpose of informal discussion about how the student liked the class and suggestions to improve it no grade was turned in for unreasonably long time holding up completion of requirement for advanced degree exasperated grad student felt she should not have to go to a professors apartment after class to get a grade since all class work had been completed and graded already student eventually told her boy friend who immediately contacted the department head and demanded the grade be posted to the transcript the grade was then posted and there was no other response from the university
i was at a conference and attended the social where a professor invited me back to his room for further discussion completely unwarranted and left me thoroughly uncomfortable more examples include uncalled for flirting while i was presenting my poster questions on whether im single comments on my clothes and appearance and basically discussing everything except my science
constant and public commentary about my sex life my husbands sexual abilities status preference in front of colleagues and my students i learned after two years of this that similar behaviour was also directed at another male pretenure colleague repeated implicit and explicit i have lots of power over your tenure application hahahaha commentary on his influence on my career trajectory when i pushed back and said that sex comment is across the line i was told that i didnt have a sense of humour gossip that i was difficult hire and wasnt as committed because my husband makes a lot of money and because my children are obviously a priority lots of low level gaslighting about a range of issues i quickly implemented a system of everything goes in writing via email his behaviour was entirely about power over me us and lessened almost immediately after i received my tenure decision he still tries to pull rank power tricks on me but ive since said everything except get the fuck out of my office stopping short only because of collegiality and all of that

on five separate occasions at rehearsals production meetings and once just passing in the hall this professor placed his hand on the exact spot between my lower back and upper butt every time i immediately tensed and shifted away it never stopped him from doing it again and i finally started making sure there was either several feet of space or a male body between us i never saw him touch a male student in this way

what i expeirenced was not sexual harassment that is it was not sexual in nature but genderbased harassment bullying and harassment because im a woman i was consistently bullied yelled and cursed at in department meetings chased down the hall while being screamed at by one senior male professor in my department and also strongly and consistently undermined by another senior professor in my department which i only found out about later i was not treated equally to the male assistant professors similar achievements did not count for as much as me similar weaknesses were counted more heavily against me although many younger male colleagues expressed sympathy and support in private conversations no one supported me publicly e g in department meetings i was on my own to defend myself and therefore was considered strident and unpleasant
my advisor who was also the graduate program director was notorious for staring at womens breasts there was no way to hide this trait he did it seemingly unabashedly most often in personal meetings
at a small dinner party that took place at a graduate student house where this tenured professor was living for the summer the tenured professor and i a graduate student got into a discussion about gramsci i told the professor i thought he was wrong he called me a fucking skank twice after the second time i told him not to say it again or i would throw a glass of wine in his face he called me a fucking skank again i threw the wine in his face i was asked to leave the party he remained with the other guests all men this was the summer of this professor has also raped a woman who was an undergraduate at our institution

during my phd the professor who i was assigned to made multiple lewd comments towards me and eventually asked me out when i refused he refused to work with me thus limiting my publishing abilities i told the university about him and they did respond they limited the professors summer teaching abilities and grant receiving abilities and put me with another female professor this female professor had actually been told in the past by the offending professor and other male professors that she would never receive tenure because she was a women eventually the offending professor left the university and went to another and actually was arrested at one point for bringing a gun to class and threatening students it is also important to note that he married another phd students about months after the incident with me the female professor received full professorship about years after the original statement when the university had finally had almost a full turnover i cannot even put into words the about of frustration and hatred i have towards my present place of employment i have been here for years i have been told by two different deans to go home and take care of my kids and not work i have had multiple lewd disrespectful and flat out abusive comments made towards me by different department chairs and other faculty there was even two incidences of rape that were reported in a student organization male advisor raping female students over the past years both incidences were completely ignored by the university and the national chapter of the organization the advisor is still part of the organization
what occurred for me was relatively minor i was typically told sexist or possibly sexual comments for example that i always dress very nicely that i would have an easy time getting a job due to being a woman he would also ask me to do tasks unrelated to my actual job at the time i did not think of these requests as sexual harassment but in retrospect i suspect they may have been a way to have me come to his house alone call him on the phone more often etc for example he would often have me order pick up and deliver food to his house for student meetings he would hold there he was later accused of a much more serious incidence of sexual harassment by another ta although i was not the victim of this final incident i feel it is the one that has actually had the most impact on my career

mine happened at an academic conference i was a grad student hoping to network i met a colleague of a friend a recent graduate who had landed a tenuretrack job we chatted he introduced me to people higher up in my field funny enough people i hadnt approached before because i was warned they were sexual predators thus to be careful all happening at the bar where people mingle at conferences i feel safe with this person as a buffer and i assume things wont get weird since we both mentioned our significant others things did get weird at the end of the evening when going to the elevators after what i thought was a fun platonic evening of chatting with colleagues he aggressively starts making out with me i try to disengage but it will take me about minutes for me to convince him to go to his room i woke up confused and with bruises when the next day i told him he had misunderstood my intent he got angry and said well it sounds like youre saying i assaulted you but you were drunk i had drank moderately and were flirting all night i wasnt im ashamed to say i believed him rather than face the fact my one successful networking achievement had actually assaulted me the flirting continued periodically for a few years at various conferences continuing to confuse me
i was publicly denigrated and sexualized for being interested in critical theory like the male graduate students in my department were
first year of my phd program a male student in my cohort stalked and harassed me for months after i tried to politely reject his advances at one point when i had begun to fear for my safety i met with our dgs to discuss his behavior and he knocked on her door during the meeting and loudly made comments that clearly indicated he knew i was inside it was one of the scariest moments of my life fearing that his behavior would just continue escalating i filed a title ix complaint and he was found responsible for harassment he filed an appeal which was denied so then he sued me for defamation fortunately i found a law firm to represent me probono and they got the lawsuit dismissed however i still had to pay the outofpocket fees which cost me about k of my grad student stipend this was a few years ago but hes still in our program and a few months ago i was contacted by an undergrad apparently she heard he had sued a woman googled the case and found my name who said he sexually assaulted her after meeting at a schoolorganized club i encouraged her to report him
i was starstruck by this distinguished professor and readily accepted his offers to help me get into grad school when he subsequently began to flirt with me i was beyond flattered his charisma blinded me to the power imbalances that made the notion of consent between us problematic this imbalance only intensified once i followed him to his department and became his advisee he knew that he was the only faculty who had overlapping interests with mine and that i based my decision upon my understanding that our relationship would become more professional by necessity he only stood by this promise for two weeks before requesting oral sex that surprised me by being unreciprocated a few days later he notified me that he had had a change of heart and that our relationship would need to become strictly professional he listed a number of reasons behind this decision such as the negative consequences that would befall me if anyone were to find out lurking behind these seemingly concerned words was a clear threat he would continue a professional and supportive relationship with me if i kept quiet this threat was obscured by his insistence that i had power too that if his family found out they would leave him i didnt realize he was my abuser my captor until a year and a half later when i called a crisis hotline to get help with my selfdiagnosed stockholm syndrome this happened two weeks into my phd program he continued to function as my teacher and my mentor but he withdrew the warmth that i had come to depend on within an otherwise hostile department i was worried that he would lose professional interest in me now that sex was off the table i obsessed over ways to get that warmth back to rekindle his interest in me i spent copious amounts of my mental energy on my appearance on days that i would see him reasoning that it was in my professional interest if he thought i was pretty i found myself in uncharted emotional territories that consumed me for years he is still my adviser
constant inappropriate jokes sexual in nature and creepy once wore same outfit two days in a row got suggested was bc had done walk of shame ditto every time i yawned and said was tiredsuggestion was bc was up late having sex not grading prepping remarks above crawling on floor i was sitting down to sort files in my own office just general boundary skirting with sexually suggestive stuff right below actionable of course grad students have told mw while discussing weinstein hes much much creepier with them and pushes boundaries on regular i got a weird feeling when i saw how much he paid attention to inebriated grad student at dept holiday but kept it to myself regularly makes up excuses to talk to me even though body language etc convey i dont want to and now that chairship is over there is no reason
a linguistics professor and language instructor i was studying with groped and forcefully kissed me in his office when i rejected his advances he continued to pressure me and eventually said it would be impossible for him to continue teaching me or having any professional relationship with him if i wouldnt have an affair with him even after i stopped studying with him he sent me numerous sexually suggestive text messages until i blocked his number
visiting prospective grad student rubbed my leg up under the table and down while we were having a group welcome lunch i was so shocked and confused thought i was imagining it but it just got worse through the lunch he then made a sexually suggestive remark to me later in the day it was completely inappropriate and i had given zero indication of being interested
i was part of a student committee preparing to meet with a dean who was notorious for the way he treated female students he openly leered at women and i had experienced that on a few occasions i was the only woman on the committee of six and i mentioned in a planning meeting that i wanted one of my colleagues to sit next to the dean so i didnt have to when one of the students asked why i said i didnt want him to be able to touch me and i didnt want him looking down my shirt this male student responded well maybe that would be a good thing if it could get us what we want i had another male student colleague tell me that my best shot at academic success would be to wear a lowcut blouse to all meetings with my advisor i was in a graduate seminar where the female students got lower grades than the male students i was in a graduate seminar where every time a male student made an observation the professor would refer to it later by saying as joe said a moment ago but if a woman made a remark the professor wanted to bring up later he would say somebody pointed out the same professor routinely mocked a female colleague for all sorts of things during the gentle chitchat before class began
ive been for a few years now at an institution where this behavior is endemic and everyone turns a blind eye i was told from my very first month there by colleagues and students of multiple professors who routinely made sexual advances to students in class and out a professor whod raped a student a professor who exposed himself to students a professor who had sex with a student in his open office on and on i witnessed some of this behavior myself i confided in my chair an older woman who told me men have their needs and refused to believe me or use her social capital to intervene i asked everyone up the ladder for help no one would do anything the old boys club protected its own and junior and female faculty never seemed to survive past a couple of years
at the university of houston business school
senior faculty member entered my office to discuss an email i had sent to him expressing interest in summer teaching he was known to harass young female graduate students so i was on guard when he entered it was a group office but when he saw that i was alone he shut the door behind him he mentioned the email about summer teaching and i responded that i was very interested and happy to be involved in whatever way possible or something to that effect i was intentionally vague because i was new in the program and wasnt sure what the opportunities were so i wanted to appear enthusiastic and flexible to maximize my chances of getting a gig for the summer he responded wow i love it when women say that to me i rebuked him saying dr xxx i emailed you about teaching if that is what you are here to discuss that is fine but otherwise you need to leave my office he left i did not get a summer teaching gig he oversaw teaching for the next three years and during that time i was never assigned a winter or summer course and never received any responses to emails that i sent him requesting teaching opportunities this stalled the development of teaching experience for my cv

sexual tension and pressure used to barter promotion to tenure track
i had just started my phd and i got talking to a senior professor in a uk university and we found out we both come from the same area i like walks in the countryside and he said he could give me some maps he emailed me arranging a time for me to go to his office to collect the walking maps just before the meeting he contacted me telling him to meet me in town and hell buy me dinner i thought this was weird but thought ok and i went we went to dinner it was like a date he insisted on walking me home i said it was not necessary but he kept insisting when we got outside my house i could see where this was leading so i played dumb like i didnt know and went inside my house he also asked me at the dinner not to tell my phd supervisor about this because she gossips we didnt speak after that despite being in the same department he eventually left and got another job good
a junior faculty member with whom i struck up a friendship decided to pursue a romantic relationship even thought we were both already in relationships i told him i was not interested he accused me of having led him on because of supposed low selfesteem and gave suggestions on how to change my life and future conduct i told him he was incorrect and that i was not interested over the next months i believe he started spreading rumors about me among the faculty who stopped inviting me to join them for friday drinks and began to exclude me when the current head of department retired and was replaced by one of my harassers friends my teaching contracts were not renewed i later heard from other people that he and i had had a relationship and that i had used him
i was harassed by an external collaborator on a field project when i was a graduate student the project involved many hours in the field working with specialized equipment on which he trained me while working together he would constantly ask me questions about my relationship status my sexual experiences and what the inside of my bedroom looked like when we were working together on the equipment he would also stand so close behind me that he was literally breathing down my neck and would also try to rub my shoulders until i objected verbally the most memorable incident happened when he was driving me out to a field site he was eating a fast food hamburger and some ketchup dripped into his lap he handed me a napkin and ordered me to wipe the stain off of his crotch which i refused to do i eventually complained to my adviser and he told my harasser that the behavior had to stop or the project would be cancelled it did for about a week then gradually the behavior crept back in fortunately the project ended soon after but the harasser kept calling me every few months on my personal cell phone for about five years afterward just to chat
about a decade and a half ago a number of female students started to come to my office asking how to make sense of the fact that two of our male faculty students one full another assistant tt were dating graduate students i was one of a handful of women tenured in my department i brought up the incident with my chair and he appointed me together with two other colleagues both of them my seniors one male and one female to deal with this we had meetings with grad students discussions meetings another female grad student came to me confidentially to complain about another male senior faculty member dating graduate students i made a big stink about it in the department and as a result i was identified as a bully a mccarthylike figure and someone to avoid one single person another woman full professor she was not on the committee appointed to deal with this defended me publicly other women kept coming into my office and virtually holding my hand as to how awful it was that i had to deal with this a prospective female faculty member was repeatedly disrespected by senior faculty members who refused to refer to this candidate as dr and instead calling her ms in the documentation forwarded to the department and discussions in the department the other candidates all of whom were male were just dr one senior male faculty member insinuated in this and other ways that were not about the substance of her work that this person was not qualified for a position in our department i called him on it in a department meeting he stopped but there was no other senior colleague in the department who stood up for this person publicly i again got some private thank yous but that was the end of the discussion a senior female colleague has told female students directly that if they get pregnant they need to have an abortion she also let another male senior colleague know that she considered no longer writing letters for a female grad student when that person had a child
an unmarried prof in a graduate program at a large state university invited female grad students to come individually to his apartment for a glass of wine after the last class but before grades were turned in for the alleged purpose of informal discussion about how the student liked the class and suggestions to improve it no grade was turned in for unreasonably long time holding up completion of requirement for advanced degree exasperated grad student felt she should not have to go to a professors apartment after class to get a grade since all class work had been completed and graded already student eventually told her boy friend who immediately contacted the department head and demanded the grade be posted to the transcript the grade was then posted and there was no other response from the university
after taking several classes from a respected senior male professor and expressing interest in majoring in foreign policy with the idea of entering the foreign service the professor invited me to join him for lunch after appropriate professional conversation he began to ask about my personal life he indicated that he and his wife had an open marriage being young i was not yet and naive i didnt fully understand what he was suggesting but the whole conversation made me uncomfortable after several other suggestive incidents generally subtle comments and looks i changed my major within the department so i wouldnt have to take any additional courses from him

october i had to attend a course on teaching before i could teach as a grad student so there were other phd students from all departments we were put into small groups to make it easier to interact and work on whatever assignments we had a man sat beside me and we had to introduce ourselves and write down a question to find out more about them this individual wrote down that he just wanted to be with me i laughed it off because i thought i would never see this guy again sadly he became a physical and virtual stalker to the point that he was following me places i used to like to work late at the university the grad building and he had overheard me telling someone i was going to be there late i drove by the place at pm and he was standing outside the door you needed a pass to get in i kept driving he stalked me to the point where i was scared for my safety he would send me numerous message several an hour late at night and i stopped responding to them he also met with my supervisor to find out more about me my supervisor didnt know at the time that this guy had begun to be obsessive so naively he gave him information about me he was under the impression that i knew this stalker and that we were friends the stalker would send me messages saying that my supervisor wanted me to meet with him among other things and when i stopped responding his emails got more and more threatening and hostile i told my supervisor who agreed that there was something wrong so he met with the guy the guy continued to put things notes presents etc in my department mailbox email me and stalk me i finally went to the police and they gave me tips on how to stay safe never walk alone let others know where you are dont reply to the guy etc and told me to wipe my online profile so i did this started in and to this day this guy still emails me i do not respond and follows me on academia
in my second year as a phd student a senior colleague got me alone at friday night drinks aggressively kissed me then asked if i wanted to go and have sex with him in his office at a similar occasion on a separate night he dragged me into the mens toilet to try to kiss me hes married with children i thought he was interested in my research when we first spoke
during my th year of graduate school my advisor who was a recent hire told me two stories about undergraduates coming on to him and a few months later wrote me a suggestive note that invited me to start a sexual relationship with him i told a nontenured female mentor in another department and spoke with hr about reporting after speaking with them i decided to confront him myself during a meeting when confronted he denied that he meant any of it after that i did not experience continued advances
my outfit choices and manner of walk were routinely commented upon by a senior faculty member sometimes from all the way down the hall i was called into a senior professors office where he apologized for coarse language used by another colleague i wouldnt want my wife to hear that language a senior professor sang a bob dylan song to me in the hallway as i walked with two other colleagues whats a sweetheart like you doing in a place like this
two men in my department always made me feel like they were checking me out however it as after we went to a conference together and they saw me dance that they commented to other students about how sexy i was and how male students would cream their pants if they saw me dance i couldnt believe they spoke that way to students about me when i approached them to ask them to stop they got indignant and to this day they call me bitch or crazy bitch to students
in i was a sophomore at a junior college studying music a teacher who i had had the previous semester started coming into my practice room and sitting very close to me on the piano bench telling me how talented i was one day he invited me on a hike i did not know how to say no so i went on the hike he very suddenly turned to me and kissed me sticking his tongue in my mouth i pulled away and walked down an embankment and sat on a log i wanted to get away but i was afraid of making him angry i didnt know what to do he followed me and sat down next to me and kissed me again simultaneously grabbing me between the legs and then said i can feel how wet you are for me i jumped up and demanded he take me back to campus he was angry and stormed past me he took me back and never spoke to me again i avoided the music department for the rest of the semester then transferred out this was hard i was studying music and there all the time i lived in fear of running into him or of him coming into my practice room
my advisor got much too drunk at a scientific conference he gave me smothering hugs and would not leave me alone he kissed me on the cheek at which point i demanded some distance
ive been lucky in my mentors but my ability to network with fellow academics mostly grad students has been really hurt by the number of men who dont want to work with me as a colleague a typical scenario i had a research fellowship to do work at a small archive and there was a male grad student working there as part of the same program we saw each other every day and i tried to be collegial because we were working together he was interesting and his project was legitimately really good eventually we got lunch together and it came up that i was in a relationship immediately the grad students face fell and he looked ashen we finished lunch and for the next few weeks he barely spoke to me i havent spoken to the grad student since ive had other incidents where male grad students suggest doing conference panels together working together in writing groups and sharing networking contacts but they suddenly vanish when my relationship status comes up closing off opportunities like that isnt something that you can report because really all theyve done is wasted my time and energy it makes me suspicious about networking with male academics and it was a factor in my decision to seek work outside academia
sexual comments and harassment in the classroom laughed off by chair sexual comments and harassment by fellow department members unwanted inappropriate physical contact from chair

i was active in campus politics and in a fight to prevent my institution from moving our english dept lecturers to a teaching load this was during the time that a budget crisis also cause a furlough and i was reported by a student for mentioning the furlough in class in defiance of a request that we not do so the dean called me in to his office to yell at me not for violating a university policy but for violating an implied linkage between two policies i was pretenure and a single mother going through a divorce it was made clear to me based on that one instance that because the dean was vengeful and i was a troublemaker that i was safer finding another tenure track job because he would probably block my tenure application
my philosophy professor told me that he didnt understand my essay follow my contributions in class asked for follow up he said it just doesnt make any sense rereading later i dont see whats so opaque about that essay but i did see that i was the only girl in the class and the only one not to get an a in the class overall other than the kid who never showed up
first year on the tenure line another male faculty member entered my office and shut the door and asked me to have a sexual affair with him because his wife wasnt doing it for or with him anymore after getting rejected he tried several additional times to send me obscene emails to my personal account and facebook
my professor propositioned me for sex after an evening of grooming ex telling me that i was really smart and attractive i adamantly refused his propositioning only to have him try to persuade me against my wishes i continued to push back but remained polite so as not to ruin the evening or the friendly professional relationship i thought id built with this person when i asked for him to drive me home he proceeded to try to push me for sex again which i refused during the ride he remarked how his girlfriend wouldnt have approved if wed chosen to get to together his girlfriend was a former student of his somehow even younger than myself
lewd comments about young male student athletes volunteering in lab
male professor would stare at my breasts every time i spoke was around him he often told me how i should go to his house for dinner someday he once told me that id make a great high school teacher since it would let me be a stellar wife too there are a number of rumors stories of this same man having sex with his students and stealing money from the department
while a student at the u of a it was an open secret that several professors female and male were engaging in affairs with students when deciding on graduate studies i was warned by a trustworthy senior professor about who to avoid
a tenured professor and later the chair who was working with grad students would give teaching gigs and opportunities for additional employment income professional development based on gender and sexual orientation and also based on what other professors you worked with this professor chair also told inappropriate jokes in class and outed though sarcastic meanspirited jokes lgbt students in class this professor got away with it because she was a lesbian and it was disguised as playful in class this professor would also question certain students intellect and make inappropriate jokes about not knowing about certain fields of research or not immediately grasping concepts theories
the lab manager in the lab i was working in is a habitual sexual harasser he has made sexual comments to many if not most of the female staff and students in the lab this was especially egregious in situations where he was drinking alcohol department parties conferences lab outings on one occasion he loudly and repeatedly asked female students and staff members including me about our masturbation habits this was in from of our supervisor primary investigator on another occasion another female student and i were comparing the boots we were wearing as they both had decorative straps on them the lab manager interjected asking us whether those straps were used to hold our legs up during sex these are a few of the more salient incidents with this lab manager there are many other passing comments made over the years i worked in that lab that made me uncomfortable while i didnt feel safe calling him out directly i made it as clear as i could that his behaviour was unacceptable to me i did not laugh or respond to his comments i got the impression that he resented me for this and he spoke negatively to our supervisor about me on several occasions
when i was an undergrad at the university of chicago and in the early years of grad school at penn i was sexually harrassed by a mentor he put enormous pressure on me to respond to his desires and i resisted when he and i moved to penn there was a moment when in a sick moment he stuck his tongue inside my mouth and i let him feel me
excessive flirting including overtly sexual conversations despite multiple requests for appropriate boundaries positive reinforcement increased attention approval and occasionally research opportunities when young female lab members dressed attractively sexist jokes during meetings these were annoying but mostly harmless punishment humiliation silent treatment when i tried to raise concerns about the flirting gaslighting after that things like i never said that youre imagining things eventually escalating to teasing and namecalling about me being paranoid
a tenured faculty member from another department would openly check out my ass when i was a graduate student he would purposely come out of his office to my departments side of the building when he heard my voice in the hall i tried to ignore him at first and then gave him dirty looks when i caught him he followed me to my office once and blocked the door way asking me what my problem was i was terrified because he was much larger than me i was alone and he was blocking the doorway so i told him nothing he continued the behavior until he asked me what my problem was and i told him he was checking me out i then filed a complaint because i was terrified of retaliation but he continued the behavior until i left the institution
among the more minor things such as having my appearance commented on regularly and having male colleagues come into my office without knocking when the door is closed and so on i have been asked out repeatedly by professors whose courses i was taking as a grad student asked out repeatedly senior colleagues groped by a senior male colleague administrator received sexually explicit and unsolicited emails from senior male colleagues been called to an administrators office because one of these colleagues wanted to understand why i was besmirching his name even though i hadnt said a word about his behavior and i have been intimidated in person and via email by perpetrators so that i would not go public about these incidents
during an interview with a wealthy alumni donor my mentor and the college dean the donor looked me up and down and told me i was too pretty to be a scientist i looked like a call girl i was wearing a calf length skirt suit with a very boxy jacket he insisted i sit next to him on the couch to talk about my work and then scolded me for not looking him in the eye and smiling more
this was just the worst of and by many the year was mid s i had known this person for several years during and after graduate school i drove him home one night after dinner he invited me to get a book and once in his apartment began trying to kiss me this was a complete shock hed never pulled anything like this with me i pushed him away several times on my way to the door however before i reached the door he was able to grab me and hold me down long enough to shove his hand down the back of my skirt and under my tights to shove a finger up my ass
while serving as an associate dean the dean started approaching me to share hotel rooms with him on business trips and to become involved sexually i said no several times and started finding reasons to miss lunch meetings and bow out of conferences and to work from home over the course of several months he continued to press me eventually i agreed to become involved he disclosed he was also involved with two other women in our faculty one woman was untenured and had been for several years when i tried to get out of the situation and refused to share a hotel room with him he said he had gone to the wall for me regarding my application for a promotion i did get out of the situation but i did not report it i consulted with our director of human rights and equity who told me that over the years there were campus rumours about this dean regarding inappropriate relationships i guess i wasnt in the circle where those rumours were circulating i see now there are various codes of silence operating around these issues
in when i was a graduate student at the university of nebraska lincoln in the department of english i attended a seminar session held at a professors home the professor was well regarded in his field and this final class session was meant to conclude the semesters classes he cooked and baked for the classa small group of students at a point midway through the dinner i went from the table to kitchen to get more water and he came up behind me pressed himself against me held me against him so that i could feel his erection he kissed my neck and placed his hands on me i froze in the moment but then pulled away he didnt speak during this episode i tried to leave as soon as possible feigning some excuse i felt embarrassed and sickened
as i was completing my ma my advisor became increasingly touchy feely he would place his hands on my hips my waist my shoulders when we were in his office i did my best to dance away in celebration of my ma defense he took me to a local restaurant where he kissed me on the lips that evening i emailed him to say that i had not consented to the kiss and did not want it to happen again he admitted to it and replied that it was an unintended gesture but it was clearly planned as he knew that i had left my husband mere weeks before and that i was in a seriously vulnerable position
i was sexually assaulted my two professors in my field of study the first is a known predator and i hope that his many years of hiding in plain sight will soon be over the second is internationally renowned and excessively admired i simply would not be believed his assault was so violent that i had bite marks all over my face and had to teach the next day
i was a student in a biology field course the latecareer distinguished professor instructing the course used binoculars to watch female students bathing in a lake we were in a remote area without facilities while masturbating according to a male student who reported this to me the professor apparently according to the male student said that he was frustrated with me for wearing a swimsuit in the lake to bathe unlike the other female students he decided to get back at me for my modesty by calling me into a communal male shower room at another location later in the course where he and approximately five other adult men who were either students or associated with the courses teaching staff were naked he and the other men formed a gauntlet that i had to walk through to leave the shower room all of them laughed at me for my modesty at being shocked and horrified to see them all naked
i was a beginning graduate student having coffee with a more advanced male graduate student he was helping me understand some technical stuff two male professors happened by and joined us the conversation continued i didnt contribute much because i was soaking it in plus imposter syndrome then one of the professors turned to me and said name your eyes are so blue today obviously he thought the poor little girl was bored listening to the big men talk and decided to bring me into the conversation by commenting on my appearance i was crushed and felt put in my place
my professor advisor thesis chair asked me to kiss him
i was at a party at a bar during a conference we all have had a couple of drinks i was talking to a senior professor when all of a sudden she said this is how we do it around here and she french kissed me i was surprised to say the least and did not exactly know how to react i turned around and went back to my colleagues
male academic colleague repeatedly pushed me forcibly forward from behind while i spoke with other colleagues in public spaces not just on campus causing me to stumble forwards he treated it as a joke but it was obviously an attempt to humiliate me in front of others
my professor asked me to have sex with him while we were alone and working on processing tissue on a saturday this proposition followed months of him taking me out for coffee under the guise of mentor ship where he increasingly positioned himself on a pedestal relative to me and tossed in questions about my sexual preferences and past in the context of a burgeoning friendship he was in an unhappy marriage didnt have many friends and described his personal life with her at length to me i answered his questions by carefully skirting around them and redirecting the conversation to neutral ground he didnt seem bothered by my lack of engagement in any of it and seemed relieved for an opportunity to share his thoughts and feelings freely he should have just gone to therapy when i rejected the proposition to have sex with him which shocked me i stammered that i wasnt comfortable mixing business and pleasure he became defensive and embarrassed i attempted to play it off and in the moment believed that i had done so and left the incident behind me two weeks later we met in his office to go over the things i needed to begin my next set of experiments he closed the door and told me i didnt deserve any of it had an arrogant and entitled approach to science and that unless i mended our relationship would never have a future in science since he held all power over my future further he reneged on a previously arranged agreement to allow me flexibility to ta for additional semesters to make my financial ends meet he forbid me to find external employment and told me just to deal with it knowing i was under financial duress i reported it to my department head who made a note in a file and asked me if i wanted to switch labs i was asked if he touched me if i had any proof of explicit messages or if anyone had borne witness of course i had none of these things since this was the only lab in the entire school doing the kind of work i was interested in i stuck it out my supervisor didnt speak to me for an entire year and i completed the remainder of my experiments alone
my graduate advisor had a history of harassing female students and harassed me though it was years ago i do not care to recount the details sorry if that is not helpful to your project
two of the most significant incidents happened almost immediately one after the other shortly before completion of my postgraduate degree harassed and threatened attempted rape by fellow postgraduate student at a course event fully raped by an informant during ethnographic fieldwork
a male grad student colleague was interested in me romantically after i night out a bar i rejected him by way of not answering my phone when he wanted to hang out he came over to me house shirtless and drunk and fought his way into my doorway and at the top of his lungs called me a dirty whore and a fucking bitch he grabbed me by my wrists and i pulled away with all of my might he let go suddenly and i fell back and injured myself and limped the next day he finally stepped out and i quickly closed and locked the door on him and he continued to call me a whore and broke the handle off of my door my partner at the time also an academic blamed me for being too flirtatious with this man other colleagues who knew about this remained very friendly with him that was the worst part i felt abandoned by everyone i knew
as a ta for a large intro course i female was assaulted by a male student who was unsatisfied with his grade on an assignment he attacked me in front of several other graduate students called me a variety of names and had to be pulled off of me by two bystanders i reported this to the professor of the class recipient of a macarthur genius grant and told him i thought the grade was more than fair it was a solid d paper but id given him a c the professor read the paper and said even a d was generous however he then raised the students grade to a b thereby rewarding him for attacking me
i had set up a meeting with a professor to discuss doing a summer research project with him during the meeting he asked me inappropriate questions whether i had a boyfriend was he was my first love things like that i remember feeling so uncomfortable i dont remember him talking about his research at all after the meeting i told some friends and i learned that there were all sorts of rumors about this professor and inappropriate relationships with female undergraduates
in the fall semester my ta for my general chemistry lab was a little handsy benign high fives became lingering shoulder pats to resting his hand on the small of my back or on my thigh i never said anything in protest even though he was making me incredibly uncomfortable because he had a hot temper but was helping me a lot in the class
on multiple occasions when meeting with one of my supervisors he would at some stage be staring at my chest for an extended period i thought maybe i was imagining it or overinterpreting it until another female student said he regularly did the same to her she called him out on it at least once
at a conference an mfa professor and major gatekeeper at my field grabbed my ponytail held it up and said whoa who ever thought that my name would turn into a babe he had nicknames for all the girls and was riotously sexist but apparently this was ok because he was gay so it was a joke and we were allies
during my undergrad the department chair a married father perhaps in his mid forties carried on an affair with a first year undergrad it was very public theyd be cuddling in the agora the context for them meeting was an office visit about her poetry journal i was also asked to go discuss my journal in office hours i didnt go this is an example of something that didnt happen to me but contributed to a climate in which female students a were sexualized and b lost any meaningful access to an instructor for mentorship or otherwise being taken seriously
school year over two semesters when he was teaching two required courses for my first year of graduate school professor in my department sexually harassed me and a number of other female students in my case he would insist that i meet with him instead of the ta for the course when i would get to his office he would insist that i close the door even though i said i was fine with it open then he would insist that i sit right next to him on his side of the desk instead of sitting across the desk from him like i originally did when i offered resistance to that request he insisted and implied that he wouldnt help me unless i moved once i was sitting next to him he would then put his hands on my back and or shoulders while explaining concepts to me i had been warned he was handsy in his office and so i always sat so that he couldnt touch my thighs like i had been warned he did to other students when another student filed a complaint against him he attempted multiple times to intimidate me into not providing testimony against him
a supervisor teaching me a medical procedure gratuitously pressed his whole body against mine as if he was spooning me
example i was repeatedly sexually harassed while in the coursework portion of my phd program by a student in a previous year he had repeatedly told me he thought i was awful but then began making comments like he would have sex with me to shut me up or im much more attractive when my mouth is shut or id be more attractive with something in my mouth he made sexual gestures once standing in the back of the room while i was presenting a paper in a class example i was in my second year in the same program a student contacted me after we exchanged numbers while working on a class project he wanted to get a workout buddy i was game at first but wanted to make sure he was aware i had a boyfriend and would not date other people in the program under any circumstances he assured me he was gay and we were just friends we hung out a couple of times and then he turned really touchyfeely i made it known i did not like that he apologized but then called me again and again begging me to hang out i did not want to so i texted him back and said i was not interested because i found him too involved in my personal life and needed to just keep things professional he responded by threatening to kill himself if i would not see him and pleaded with me to leave my boyfriend after i blocked his number and reported it he insisted on sitting next to me in class trying to have sidebar conversations with me and stole my notes while i was writing the professor of the class who had been alerted to the issue not only did nothing he reduced my participation grade for being distracting
i was an undergrad at a community college and i had a meeting with my english professor to talk about a paper after giving me feedback once comment including i should use more of my own voice he playfully said to get out of here before he would have to spank me as he held the paper up over his head about to perform the action i nervously laughed and left i was
the most egregious is when i was repeatedly asked out by a professor with whom i was doing a directed study onetoone reading seminar i was a st year phd student he was recently divorced he ended up showing up at a party i was at held at another faculty members house and followed me around all night creepy as hell even after i said no and no and no but the power dynamic was obvious other incidents were less obvious there was a male faculty member well known in the department who only invited men to speak in class he held a boysonly basketball game regularly as well as cigar nights at his house no women were ever invited he made sexist remarks in class usually about womens lessthan ability in a historical or contemporary context he was also known for putting his arm around womengrad students shoulders or putting his hand on their backs i saw that myself and if my peers are to be believed no women ever got an a in any of his classes i dont know if thats true or not but its plausible
students told me that a professor went on an extended rant about the threat of homosexuality in their bible as literature course telling students including lgbtq students that they would feel differently about the issue when they had to keep their children from turning gay he had previously made insulting comments about how disgusting fat women are it emerged that this same professor had been so irritated by the proposal of a program in womens and gender studies years early that he had put together a satirical proposal for a fat people studies and submitted it to the university note that he did not intend this as a genuine contribution to the field of what we now call fat studies he made it clear that it was meant to be an equally ridiculous proposal to the one moving forward as wgs when other senior faculty were asked about these incidents they replied morosely that this is just the way this professor is
my publisher wouldnt stop touching me when i said something to the editor she said everyone knew he was a lech with young women so i should keep a table between us
pi entertained conversations on a regular basis with male lab mates about women in the scientific realm discussion would take place in the office area shared with female graduate post docs and these conversations sexualized women and outwardly judged women in the field about their relationships and desires to have children
in my genetics professor would repeatedly send me sexually explicit emails addressed to his girlfriend first i ignored it the second time i politely responded that he had the wrong address the third time i confronted him after class he explained that my name was next to hers in his address book and it was a mistake the next time it happened i confronted him again and his creepy response was curiouser and curiouser

for the most part this was harassmentbecauseofsex and not of a sexual nature my graduate assistantship was editorial and i reported to a male boss whose office i was often in alone he teased and belittled me making fun of my clothes for being too professional and trying too hard i wore the typical male work uniform of oxfordstyle shoes pants a blazer but apparently for women this wasnt appropriate and my body language he would get up and imitate the way i stood then tell me i was acting insecure or childlike perhaps because he made me feel those things whenever i mentioned or made edits related to sex gender race or sexuality hed make comments like you and your girlpower thing again he often told me id grow out of my naivete and idealism when i was older i was male employees did not report having to deal with these attitudes a year into the year position i came in to his office to find a screenshot of my face from a music video id been in as his computer background i had told him i was in the video because it caused me to miss a day of work and he bragged that he had tracked it down and was surprised how tasteful it was because he thought it would be a bunch of halfnaked women lounging on car hoods i attempted to ignore this along with all the other insults

in fall my sophomore year i enrolled in a class taught by an african american male faculty member who had a reputation for sexually harassing female students as i was african american and his previous targets had all been white i assumed i was safe around midterm he insisted i was too advanced for the topic hed assigned most of the class for a final paper and would need to meet with him in private to devise a topic for me i knew that private meetings with him had been occasions for various forms of browbeating and manipulation for other women thus i spent the remainder of the semester insisting i was too busy to meet with him and begging for a paper topic finally realizing that if i failed to write a paper because i had no assigned topic i could be flunked i explained my dilemma to another legitimately advanced student and asked her to share her topic with me adding i would do my own research and inevitably produce results different from her own so there should be no question of plagiarism she agreed i thoroughly researched and carefully wrote my paper vowing not to complain as long as the professor gave me a grade of b or above less than that and i felt confident my complaint would be taken seriously by the committee on faculty conduct as i was a wellknown wellliked student with an excellent academic record who was also one of the leaders of the campus black student organization the professor had been brought up on sexual harassment charges the previous year but managed to elude censure by painting himself a victim of racism a claim that would be much harder to make in my case i received a b for the course so felt no need to take matters further the following semester however the professor flagged me down one day in the student union he was seated with the girl whod shared her topic with me and her boyfriend another of the profs advanced students the prof proceeded to inform me hed been so impressed by my term paper that he wanted to meet with me to discuss the possibility of collaborating on its publication at that point i loudly informed him i was no longer his student told him exactly what i thought of him and marched off

while i was in my first year at law school my male classmates openly and repeatedly ranked our female classmates in order of attractiveness they would specifically discuss the merits of individual womens breasts legs butts etc i pretended not to mind and even laughed along with them if they directed conversation at me they never happened to mention my rank when i was around for these conversations

a male graduate student in my department would routinely hunt for a new unsuspecting female graduate student every new student orientation he especially liked single mothers in our department he would be charming at first and then ridiculously controlling i could write pages regarding his bad behavior and how stressed and upsetting he would make our female students his behavior got worse as he progressed through the program yet faculty still wrote recommendation letters for him he got a job as a tenure track faculty member and his behavior didnt change there he went on to date numerous female undergrads and grads in his department till he got so obsessed with one student he dated that he stalked and harassed her when she broke it off without revealing names he eventually got fired by his university sadly it didnt end there he ended up going to the students house and shooting her dead and then he killed himself
when i was applying to do my phd a senior female member of the department to which i was applying and an exphd student of the adviser with whom i was considering working both invited me for informal meetings to talk about my application they both warned me that this particular adviser had a history of bullying his female postgraduate students i later heard that this prof had caused at least one of his female students to leave the academy because of sexual comments and other bullying behaviour
during my time as a postdoctoral fellow my senior colleague mentor asked to have a relationship with me i declined the offer this made working with him uncomfortable but because i was trying to apply for the tenure track position associated with the fellowship i never told anyone meanwhile his colleagues particularly a white female senior scholar would interrogate me about my relationship to him she asked extremely uncomfortable and investigative questions including how well do you know him how did you meet him none of the questions were about my wellbeing once i left the institution i was told my a former student that there were rumors circulating around the department that i had been sleeping with this colleague it should probably be known that i was up for a position at this university and after an intense battle did not get it
my experiences began in the spring of my junior year and lasted until graduation there were male faculty in our department who would invite female graduate students and talented undergraduates to their homes for celebrations and parties they would also hold office hours for undergraduate and graduate courses at local bars and nightclubs so that all students who had questions about final papers course materials etc would go these establishments my own experience began when my thenprofessor bought me a drink one drink turned into two drinks and it seemed relatively harmless at the time after all he kept saying what an excellent student i was a few weeks later the professor threw a party with other male faculty members at his home they invited a number of female students to attend though we didnt know that they had only invited females many of us were excited to attend as the invitation made us feel like adultslike we had finally made it alcohol flowed and a few of us were encouraged to spend the night over for our own safety i ended up leaving but my friend remained and had a sexual encounter with one of the male faculty members who was her boss it wasnt until a week later after many phone calls emails text messages that i began a sexual relationship with a male faculty member whose class was required for graduation
i needed three letters of recommendation for several highly competitive postgraduate funding programs cultivated a senior faculty member in one of my departments i doubledmajored had heard rumors of sexual relationships hed had with former students he began to request i come to office hours once or twice each week during which hed stand up from his chair and come around to the edge of the desk perching on the edge close to where i sat in a guest chair gave me extracurricular reading for outofclass oneonone discussion on the grounds that i was very gifted and doing superior work hugs at odd moments nicknames endearments all verbally nothing via email i felt like i was being groomed didnt feel like i had any material complaint to take to the chair who was also writing me rec letters and was afraid to alienate this person since the app deadlines were approaching and i had no replacement rec letter writers to call on i changed my schedule in order to avoid his office hours immediately after lectures and rearranged spring classes and senior thesis topic in order to avoid him

i was going to the shop and a man who was chewing khat got hold of my hand forcefully and tried to grab me fortunately a woman was there and warned him
what would you do if some man touches you when you are walking down the street
she is ugly and does not meet the level of the type of girl he would date
beautiful i just want to say hallo and feel how soft you are
youre sexy and we know it
these are as ripe as oranges
i want to fuck you
look your girl friend is coming
hey this girl you claim a lot as if you are the only girl in town
girls dont need to wash hand after urinating boys have to right
we are used to ladies bodies
you are boasting over gods greetings and you are not even beautiful
called us by some local names like chinky
faggoty fag fag gay secks man blowjob settle down
let that pussy freeze rotten bitey little bastard
you are a fatty fat fat
ask him why hes jumping out of the window and ask him hows he gonna do it in those tight ass jeans
obviously youre someone who likes to blow
i want to touch your legs
i wanna make u cum like u never had is that a bad thing i know you will love it
im all for this hiring women thing but not if its going to cost me three of my men every time you cant do something
women belonged at home cleaning floors
i had dream sex with you last night
did you like my porno
you get hot for beards right
were starting a pool about how fat youll get
i wanna take you in the stairwell
wow and i thought i was the only one still having wet dreams
can i watch you while you sleep
your breasts are big and you probably didnt even feel it
youre too hot to work here
come to my place i treat you dinner
you know it really doesnt matter what they write as long as youve got a young and beautiful piece of ass
she cheated on him like a dog and will do it again
when i gain weight i think of that picture
i think certain women are more beautiful than others to be perfectly honest and its fortunate i dont have to run for political office
you really cake it on dont you
who are you trying to impress
youd look so much prettier if you kept it natural
i hope you get raped again
hey girl u ever have a big black deep inside u
i want to marry you so add me please
you only got the job because youre a woman
she really wasnt that good but they really wanted to keep her
you do that so well for a girl
eyed her up and down
at my old job there were rumors that i had the job because the boss had feelings for me or that we had slept together or because i wore tight skirts
a little spanking would help speed things along
treat me as just someone to hit on not that i am working
its too bad we didnt know each other years ago we could have had a lot of fun together
upon meeting in person a peer id only spoken to via email he said youre much prettier than i thought youd be
never knew how great your legs were
the guys in the machine shop only do things for you because you shake your tits at them
give her a sloppy french kiss for me
he would be gentle with me and only stick it half in
i feel something being shoved into my butt
his eyes were on my breasts more than they were on my face
he told me i come off as annoying and bitchy when i try to lead certain projects
why you were only hired because she liked the way you looked
get the chick to do it
i know you say you dont want to have kids but dont you love to fuck
one of them was looking at my butt when i bent over to grab something and he was trying to get his something year old son to go after a new hire who was about my age at the time
the managers used to ask me to climb the very tall ladders so they could stand below me and look up at my butt
can i put my dick in your ass
hey sexy where are you going
guys stop me on my way to work are you single
if i followed you home would you take care of me
i will bite your tongue off
hey cinderella why dont you come on over here princess
i want to fuck you with this jackhammer
why dont you put those red lips around my cock honey
youre beautiful fuck you be grateful i said that
girl your body is amazing
while i was working i had an older man looked to be in his s or s tells me that he couldnt sleep at night without me beside him in his bed and asked if i would come home with him i was absolutely disgusted that a man would say that to me as a child
one time a man told my coworker that she should wear her name tag on her shirt so that he could stare at her chest another time a drunk customer almost took his pants off in the middle of the store after she refused his advances
i was use to how the guys acted but being cornered in the small produce cooler by a rather large coworker was not something i was looking forward to he would not let me pass and believe me there was no way around him he began putting his hands on me and pulling me towards him as if to kiss then showed me his penis i had to show him i was carrying a pocketknife so that he would leave me be to be female in food service you have to have a thick skin you have to endure the sexism and the insulting jokes you have to work twice as hard as any man does just to show that you are not being a female
i was working at petsmart a few years back a male customer probably in his mid s was leering at me any time i was alone hed walk past me and say meet me outside eventually i had to go to the back to get something and i was so terrified that i had to grab a manager to accompany me in case the man tried to follow me eventually he left the store but his leering and insistence was terrifying
at a breakfast diner chain my manager put his arm around me and tried to kiss me one morning when i handed him a coffee when i reported it human resources required him to watch a sensitivity video and gave me a tencent raise
at that diner a cook trapped me in the cooler and groped me
a customer followed me to the parking and almost wouldnt let me leave
another cook pushed me into my car after my shift and unbuckled his pants food service is hell
then continue to tell me how pretty i am to the point where its uncomfortable i have said thank you and let them know its unwanted attention but it makes working uncomfortable because you dont know who youre going to run into when you clock in
you would not believe the number of times i was propositioned over the intercom at a drivethru specifically at the end of one order i asked if the customer needed anything else and he replied a blowjob would be nice i only ever had one male manager overhear and get angry on my behalf as opposed to laughing i also had more than one female coworker come to me and ask me to go out to the lobby to wipe tables change out the tea etc because male customers were leering at them asking when they got off work even catcalling them i wasnt allowed to say anything to them i dont think any manager ever made them leave i know in my time there there were no less than three male managers fired over sexual harassment
i worked at starbucks for almost three years in college when one of my coworkers and i reported our shift manager for sexual harassment we were told wed be laid off the following week
one night i was working behind the counter selling entry tickets at an arcade when this big family came in the grandpa who was probably in his late s early s was giving me creepy looks and when it was his turn to come up to the counter to get his wristband to enter the arcade he grabbed my hand stroked his finger up and down my ring finger whispered no ring and gave me this smile that made my stomach churn this was when i was and i looked like i was maybe or which means that there was absolutely no mistaking that i was underage
while working at crate and barrel customer service answering phones i had a man ask for gift box wherein he can place a cuff he purchased for his wife but the way described it he was more describing his penis it was awful and uncomfortable i never hung up on any customer besides him
i had a parttime job at a bar i was groped during a shift more recently i was tidying after a crowded party and slightly bent over whilst putting bottles in a bin and i felt someones presence behind me he was touching me inappropriately with his hands and looming over me silently this rattled me to my core
this one time a man came in with his son when i came to help them find what they were looking for the father then smiled at me in a suggestive way and asked if i could help them with underwear the father in front of his teenaged son who looked uncomfortable the whole time began asking me about myself in between he would comment on my hair on my smile how pretty i was i was a retail worker and the customer is always right even when they make you uncomfortable finally he turned to his son and he said thats it theres that blush a beautiful woman blushing is what men love in this disturbing sexual voice
my experiences with sexual harassment at my retail job ranges from verbal to physical but most of what i deal with is verbal and it comes from men of all ages ive come to almost expect it from teens to middleaged men but the most surprising was from a much older man around late s as i walked to the register to ring up him and his wife he looked me up and down and said ohhh sexy with a leering smile i was so angry because i didnt feel like i could stand up for myself for fear of my job or having worse reactions from the customer which could escalate the situation
a male customer stalked me for several weeks late last year culminating in an incident where he followed me around the shop shortly before close casually showing me what appeared to be a gun tucked into his waistband some of my male coworkers told me i was exaggerating or that the guy wasnt so bad another my manager at the time and one of the best men ive ever known bought me a knife and taught me how to use it when i told him what had happened
this happened when i was about and working in a popular retail store that sells tea and tea accessories i was alone in the store for a moment and a man comes in he starts talking to me and i go into my usual sales pitch then he randomly gets really close to me and tells me that my tits are really great he had gotten so close almost touching me after he left i was still shocked and shaking i still remember that as one of the most humiliating things that has ever happened to me and it makes me cringe every time i think about it
during the holidays id wear a santa hat to work and a male coworker once asked if i would give him my hat and sit on his lap and of course there were the guys who would ask me to massage their shoulders or feet while trying out the massage chairs calf massagers once when i refused to massage a mans feet he asked isnt that what they pay you for why else would they have women working in here after working in retail for six years i vowed i never would again women working in retail are walking targets that cant defend themselves for fear of losing their lousy low paying jobs
im currently working at starbucks and as a year old female i come across all types of guys men older men the good days are the days when they ask you if your single and why a pretty girl like you is should be alone the not so good days are the ones where they feel free to touch you a hand on your arm an unwanted hug a pat on my lower back a pat on my backside i cant say that ive been sexually harassed on the highest level still i feel like i should voice how inevitable it feels
ive had to deal with male customers who stop and comment on the fact that i rest on my knees while sticking our warehouse my favorite is you need to get up off those knees girl all while they stand and leer while licking their lips im at work i dont want to flirt with you i want to do my job and go home unmolested and unbothered i recently had a male coworker slap my behind with a fly swatter one guy i work with offered to hold my hand because i was blushing and clearly liked getting my butt spanked i wasnt blushing my ears and cheeks were red because i was mortified and angry
i worked at a wellknown hardware store and a guy came up and started hitting on me just the usual comments about my appearance and asking for my number when i said i wasnt interested he got really pushy and demanded to know why when he was ready to go he asked in front of some other staff members if i could help him carry his stuff out to his car i didnt feel like i could say no without looking like a bad employee so i helped him out and he insisted on giving me his number and said cheerfully that he was a regular customer and hed see me again
as a librarian ive been threatened with stalking for not giving my phone number to a patron ive also been shown naked sexually explicit photos and propositioned by countless men some of which were married and standing right next to their children some of my female colleagues have had male patrons waiting for them in the parking lot after work and theyve received explicit messages over social media
i got fired from a retail job because im a lesbian and wouldnt sleep with my male boss
i worked as an office manager and the only woman for an industrial insulation company i had just come back from maternity leave and i was worried about my milk supply i went into the bathroom to pump for about minutes every two hours and all of the men in the office would stand in the break area right in front of the bathroom door and make baby crying noises to make fun of me eventually it progressed to the point that they would make crying noises every time they passed my desk in hopes that i would leak through my shirt
they would also make comments about how much larger my breasts were since having a baby i felt so harassed and unsafe that i would dread going to work every day and i even had more than a few nervous breakdowns my husband was furious and i had to convince him not to take any drastic action so that i could be sure to have a good reference if i needed to find another job we had a long conversation and looked at our finances and decided the extra money wasnt worth the emotional distress
i used to work for a call center and the men there were extremely disgusting always muttering sexual comments the worst one i had was from a coworker who used to message me on the work chat room asking me to come blow him under his desk when i reported it to hr they said i was the one causing the issue
when i was or i was babysitting two kids and some other kids came over for a play date so i ended up watching them too i got a ride home from the dad of one of the kids whod come over earlier i had noticed him staring at me specifically my chest but i didnt think much of it when we got in the car he asked me where i went to school normal what i did outside of school a little weird but eh and if i had a boyfriend creepy i being an innocent lil nerd proceeded to talk about the classes i was taking and how timeconsuming but fun they were i remember feeling flattered that he asked me so many questions about my life and seemed to listen to my response i lived close by so luckily i was home before anything could happen as i was leaving the car he asked for my phone number to contact me to babysit which again is weird in retrospect because his daughters said they had a livein nanny who usually watched them i didnt have a cell at the time and told him to ask the people i babysat for regularly to send him my email he looked kinda mad but by this point i was out of the car and walking up the stairs to my front door
i work in law enforcement i started out as a correctional officer in an allmale prison when i was walking to my post one day an inmate screamed at me bitch ill beat your pussy so hard itll put you in the hospital i called a unit code because to me that is harassment violent sexual harassment but because i worked in a male prison i was supposed to let it go in one ear and out the other
i work as an administrator in higher education and the financial aid liaison constantly made advances despite me constantly telling him no one day he told me a horrible story about jacking off in his friends sperm sample he found in the fridge apparently the friend and his wife were trying fertility treatments and the wife ended up pregnant i shortly thereafter left that school to work at a different campus it wouldve been way too much political bs to go through to report someone of his position
im a waitress and i get harassed daily by customers trying to order sexual harassment is part of the culture in every restaurant ive worked for the kitchen staff openly comments on female servers and female managers the saddest thing is that its never properly addressed because cooks always have more job security than servers ive even had a male manager tell me straight up that anybody can take that coke to that table but not everyone can make an omelette
i was bartending at a restaurant and my manager told me i needed to show more boob to draw in a more steady group of regulars it was like p m on a week night and there were many kids around i laughed it off and told him maybe after the children were gone it was my first restaurant bartending job
i dont work but this happened to me at school so this boy decides to sexually harass me and so i go to the principal and they said that they would talk to him about it hes done this to other girls six of whom had reported it i became the seventh and he gets in school suspension for a week a week hes still allowed to go to school there and gets a small infraction on his record it wasnt right with me and my friends so after he got out we had multiple people walk me and the other girls around to their classes so they would feel more safe he tried to talk to me but they formed a barrier between me and him and told him that he had to go away i never felt more powerful than when i saw him get smaller and smaller down the hallway
i had a male customer ask me out for his son and when i told him i was married he asked happily are you fucking kidding me i just fucking stared at him
i was in college working at a fast food place when we got a new manager who was hired amidst plenty of backroom skullduggery one morning when i was opening the new manager was there i went to the back to get some condiments for the line and he literally shoved me up against the metal racks pressed up against me and asked if id ever done it with a black man before fortunately before i was even able to respond another worker came back and he laughed and walked away i told the other manager that i never wanted to be put on the schedule with this jerk again more backroom skullduggery and this guy was out but not fired they transferred him to another store
i work for a nonprofit and one of the services we provide is access to grant funding so that people can go back to school i was signing up an older gentleman asking the usual questions about unemployment and supplemental income and literally in the middle of the conversation he stopped me midsentence and asked has anyone ever told you you are so sexy i gave him my best icy glare told him to please focus and went on with my inquiry

i worked at a supermarket when i was and this one old guy would come in all the time and hang around one morning it was only me and another girl probably working the front end and he commented on our appearances for like ten minutes in front of other customers then he asked me if i was a virgin and told me that i better be and kept talking about it until he was kicked out after a male manager came over
another guy that i worked with was in his late s and he kept asking me out and would follow me around after his shift when i was doing carriages i had to ask my managers to make him stop
i cant even tell you the number of times the creepy maintenance guy would ask me if i wanted to see his dick my license plate is hinck my last name so i would always get hinck wanna see my dick usually with a nice crotch grab of course it was always when no one was around he was and i was or
i was on the phone with a client and he decided a professional phone call was a good time to tell me that i have a sensual voice he then proceeded to ask how old i was and if i was married he must have realized he fucked up because he opted out of phone calls and would only communicate through email after that
i used to be a marketing director for a well known quick service restaurant i would have to work with the malls marketing manager to coordinate our advertisements and their placements he would constantly make little remarks about my outfits hair and makeup at one point he invited me out to drinks i was in my s and he was i politely declined but he refused to accept no for an answer he showed up every day i was in the store to ask me and when i wasnt in he berated one of my employees until they gave him my cell phone number i quit that job because i couldnt deal with him anymore and his superiors refused to reprimand him even after my own boss stepped in on my behalf
at my corporate job i was leaving my department for a new one on my last day one of my coworkers cornered me and whipped out his dick when i shielded my eyes and yelled at him asking why he did that he told me i wanted to make sure you got the chance to see it later that same day another male coworker followed me into the elevator and tried to make out with me when i pushed him away he called me a bitch i was leaving the department to get away from them but decided to leave the entire job instead i now work with all women for a nonprofit and couldnt even imagine getting back into the corporate world
during the first month of my job at a theater i worked the night shift most days with my male supervisor one night we started talking and i gave him my snapchat just like i had done with my other coworkers that night he sent me a dick pic and asked me to rate him knowing he had a tendency to drink i shrugged it off and ignored my discomfort two days later as we were cleaning at work he sent me a snapchat that said im hard i ignored it and tried to remain calm the next day when i worked with him we were cleaning again and he told me we needed to go check one of the theaters even though we had just cleaned it and as soon as the door closed behind us he crept toward me and asked do you wanna touch it i immediately ran into the lobby where there were a few dozen people this went on for six months and i was too scared to tell my employer i was promoted to supervisor after he quit this year and i do my best to make sure none of my employees have to go through what i went through
i worked at a department store for six years i started when i was a month shy of turning and worked as a mens fitting room attendant in the mens underwear section my boss hired me because he liked the way i looked after three months of repeated complaints by me of harassment by men in the fitting room i was moved to a cashier position my boss would say this is what i want as a wife in my next life he was married about me to other employees
after three years i was promoted to bridal registry and got my own office my old boss came into my office took off his wedding band dropped it on my desk and told me the symbol is gone when i was about to file a harassment complaint against him he came out as gay and started parading his new boyfriend around the store despite his harassment over a period of four years i lost all credibility when he came out people can be bi and harass both genders
i worked as a photographer for the local newspaper when i was putting myself through college one day on a shoot the top dog on location pulled me aside and told me that he thinks about me when hes sleeping with his wife he had an yearold daughter yet he felt i t was okay to not only sexualize me but isolate me at my place of work where i couldnt lash out in retaliation i told my boss who said thats the industry and when you look like that you should expect i t
i used to work in property management my boss would hit on me constantly and since he lived on site and i worked he would come drunk in his pajamas on saturdays and ask me personal questions he would make me file in his office and just watch me once we had to check out an apartment and he closed and locked the door behind us he seemed drunk even though it was a work day and he began asking me why i think i can be so confident and think im hot shit i left and when he came back to the office he began reading my browser history to the whole staff and mocking me the next day my boyfriend brought me lunch and two hours later there was a memo about how there were no personal visits allowed this is just one example of dozens unfortunately he was much bigger than i was and luckily i didnt work there much longer but when i reported his behavior to the temp agency i went through they said they knew already it had happened to several girls before me and they just shrugged it off
i worked at a retail store and i had a boss tell me that i had really nice lips perfect dsl dick sucking lips i also had a different manager touch my ass every day when i was pulling stuff from shelves in the back room also had a manager tell me i didnt need to show my cleavage and that people would still like me even if i didnt i wasnt showing cleavage i am just very busty also had a coworker who looked down my shirt and tell me my bra was really pretty today
one last one was at a gas station where i was a manager and i was told i needed to wear makeup to appear more likable to our truck driver customers so yes pretty much being a woman in the workforce is hell
when i was i was working at a grocery store as a cashier one day as i was climbing a ladder to put up some signage a manager approached me and said i could watch you go up and and down that ladder all day you have a great ass he made comments like that to me on a regular basis i was only in high school at the time so it took me awhile but i finally reported it and he was fired
i work in a hospital these are stories about harassment by my coworkers all at work during the day in the presence of multiple people there is the young doctor who while answering a question runs his hand up and down my arm and one day told me he has a foot fetish that if he sees womens feet he loses it all while staring at my opentoed sandals there was the very important and married doctor who repeatedly emailed me late at night from his work account to flirt with me and ask me out for coffee theres the female coworker who repeatedly grabs my ass in the hallway the young doctor who only talked to me about my clothes and my red hair and showed me youtube videos about gingers and the coworker who was a handssliding down to my ass hugger going back further theres the professor who got drunk at a school party and bit me on the shoulder like with most other women youll hear from ive had so many moments like these that im sure ive forgotten many

when i was years old i got my first real job flipping burgers at a local fast food chain one of my coworkers who i hardly knew would flirt with me by sneaking up behind me and pinching or slapping my ass i was a new employee and inexperienced all i knew was that it was uncomfortable and embarrassing i never challenged the pincher or reported the harassment to my boss because both the pincher and my manager were women i am a man
from the first day at a new job a married coworker started hitting on me he sent sexual innuendos in email would linger in my office and wink at me in passing when id had enough i turned him down a week later he cornered me in the elevator and tried to kiss me i reported him but nothing was done other than moving me to another part of the office for two years he found ways to touch me and stare at me with intimidating looks i felt alone because of how my office handled it or lack thereof it only stopped when i moved to another state
when i was i went to work at my first office job at a clothing manufacturer importer the warehouse manager would constantly talk about my big boobs he asked me if my back hurt from carrying them around stared all the time and it all made me very uncomfortable i did not say anything to my boss because my manager had only been there a short time and the warehouse manager had been there for many years i was afraid of losing my job which i needed it was a very small company so when i got married i put an invitation to my wedding reception on the bulletin board for my friends and sure enough he showed up with several other coworkers he came up to me and said i guess a blowjob is out of the question i couldnt believe it
i worked at a company for nine years about a year before i left i was outside directing a delivery guy where to take a shipment it was the last day of work for one of our male employees who had gotten a new job he was in his s he came outside to say goodbye but he did so by coming up behind me and putting his mouth so close to my ear that i could feel his mustache hairs and his hot breath he whispered you have one of the nicest asses ive ever seen i laughed it off and nervously and told him to get out of here i went into the human resources office and told them what happened but i knew there was nothing that could be done he knew that too he waited until his last day his final paycheck signed no potential for punishment i still cringe when i think about it
when i was my supervisor emailed me to ask me if id ever posted nude photos online he said hed seen a girl who looked like me and thought hed ask since i seemed like a free spirit when i said no he asked me not to tell anyone hed asked given this was a sensitive situation for him

i think inappropriate comments happen on a daily basis but i just didnt realize and for a long time have thought its my fault often people will play it off as banter and will accuse you of being too sensitive in a work environment im also the youngest person at work so i often get taken advantage of in all aspects after one of our work events i was sitting with a few colleagues and clients one client kept commenting on how my boobs tits were out he was drinking but thats no excuse this is an old man and im expected to be polite to clients i then went to sit on another table where he continued to pester me and insult me regarding my boobs in front of my colleagues and other clients
of course i have had unwanted sexual advances in the workplace how many stories can i cram in words when i was the man whose children i babysat overnight tried forcing himself on me on his couch later he asked me to please join him in the bedroom and said i didnt know what i was missing when i declined when i was at my first real job my parents drove miles to see my new office and the owner gave them a tour with his hand on my ass the entire time from about i worked with a man who constantly made sexual references including asking me to come to his office to give him a birthday present i did not encourage or want any of his comments or sexual attention he was about years older than me men make comments to me i would not dream of saying to a man in a professional settings
