body_content|>8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's running
body_content|late is 5 minutes. Maximum waiting time: 6 minutes. For a girl, you have to
body_content|wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10
body_content|scale.
body_content|>
body_content|>9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a Mate's fridge is
body_content|>forbidden.  Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable.

body_content|>(in fact, even remembering your Mate's birthday is strictly optional).
body_content|>
body_content|>11. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops, not the
body_content|>weakest.
body_content|>
body_content|>12. While your girlfriend must bond with your Mates' girlfriends within 30
body_content|>minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make nice with her gal
body_content|>pals' significant dick-heads - low level sports bonding is all the law
body_content|>requires (sorry ladies, it's called a double standard and we drew the short
body_content|>straw on that one).
body_content|>
body_content|>13. Unless you have signed a lucrative endorsement contract, do not
body_content|>appear in public wearing more than one Nike swoosh.
body_content|>
body_content|>14. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you may
body_content|>always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's
body_content|>playing.
body_content|>
body_content|>15. You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have brought her
body_content|>to climax. If you trap her head under the covers for the purpose of
body_content|>flatulent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.
body_content|>
body_content|>16. It is permissible to quaff a fruity chick drink only when you're
body_content|sunning on a tropical beach....and it's delivered by a topless
body_content|supermodel...and it's free.
body_content|>
body_content|>17. Only in situations of Moral and/or Ass peril are you allowed to kick
body_content|>another guy in the nuts.
body_content|>
body_content|>18. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.
body_content|>
body_content|>19. Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.
body_content|>
body_content|>20. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem---you didn't see
body_content|>nothin'.
body_content|>
body_content|>21. Women who claim they "love to watch sports" must be treated as spies
body_content|>until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to drink as
body_content|>much beer as the other sports watchers.
body_content|>
body_content|>22. You must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the death of a
body_content|>girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire and threw
body_content|>it into a ceiling fan.
body_content|>
body_content|>23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must
body_content|>remain sober enough to fight.
body_content|>
body_content|>24. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of
body_content|>pizza, but not both. That's just plain mean.
body_content|>
body_content|>25. If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be talking
body_content|>about his choice of beer.
body_content|>
body_content|>26. Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a Mate of yours,
body_content|>except if she's withholding sex pending your response.
body_content|>
body_content|>27. Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while lifting
body_content|>weights:
body_content|>         a. Yeah, Baby, Push it!
body_content|>         b. C'mon, give me one more! Harder!
body_content|>         c. Another set and we can hit the showers! d.
body_content|>         Nice Ass, are you a Sagitarius?
body_content|>
body_content|>28. Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal footing:
body_content|>both urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other situations, an
body_content|>almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.
body_content|>
body_content|>29. Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than you are
body_content|>able to have sex with her. Keep a stopwatch by the phone; Hang up if
body_content|necessary.
body_content|>
body_content|>30. When a Mate is trying to hook you up, you may sabotage him only in a
body_content|>manner that gives you no chance of getting laid either.
body_content|>
body_content|>31. You cannot rat out a co-worker who shows up at work with a massive
body_content|>hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with
body_content|limburger cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he thinks his
body_content|monitor is broken, and have him paged over the loudspeaker every seven
body_content|minutes.
body_content|>
body_content|>32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly "just a friend"
body_content|>have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that your feeling weird and
body_content|guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a
body_content|big mistake it was.
