body_content|>These are  the rules, no exceptions especially 15. 
body_content|>  
body_content|>  
body_content|>1. Any Man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally  
body_content|>killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>2. Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>3. It is ok for a man to cry under the following circumstances:  
body_content|>>a. When a heroic dog dies to save its master  
body_content|>>b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse  
body_content|>>c. After wrecking your boss' Ferrari  
body_content|>>d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into The Crying Game  
body_content|>>e. When your Date is using her teeth  
body_content|>  
body_content|>4. Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a  
body_content|>friend out of jail within 12 hours.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>5. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend move  
body_content|>>a. Your legs have been severed in a freak threshing accident  
body_content|>  
body_content|>6. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend of a friend move:  
body_content|>>a. You'd rather stay home and watch speed buggy reruns  
body_content|>  
body_content|>7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is  off  
body_content|>limits forever, unless you actually marry her.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's  running  
body_content|>late is 5 minutes. Maximum waiting time: 6 minutes. For a girl,  you have  
body_content|>to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the  classic  
body_content|>1-10 scale.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's fridge is  
body_content|>forbidden. Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>10. No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for  another  
body_content|>man. (In fact, even remembering your buddy's birthday is strictly  
body_content|>optional.)  
body_content|>  
body_content|>11. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops,  not the  
body_content|>weakest.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>12. While your girlfriend must bond with your buddies'  girlfriends  
body_content|>within 30 minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make  nice  
body_content|>with her gal pals' significant dick-heads--- low level sports  
body_content|>bonding is all the law requires (sorry ladies, it's called a  double  
body_content|>standard because it's twice as true).  
body_content|>  
body_content|>13. Unless you have signed a lucrative endorsement contract, do  not  
body_content|>appear in public wearing more than one swoosh.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>14. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you  may  
body_content|>always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never  ask  
body_content|>who's playing.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>15. You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have  brought  
body_content|>her to climax. If you trap her head under the covers for the  purpose of  
body_content|>flatulent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>16. Only in situations of Moral and/or Ass peril are you allowed  to  
body_content|>kick another guy in the nuts.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>18. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>19. Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>20. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem---you didn't  see  
body_content|>nothin'.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>21. Women who claim they "love to watch sports" must be treated  as  
body_content|>spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the  ability to  
body_content|>pick a buffalo wing clean (chicken wing).  
body_content|>  
body_content|>22. You must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the  death of a  
body_content|>girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire  
body_content|>and threw it into a ceiling fan.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman  must  
body_content|>remain sober enough to fight.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>24. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice  of  
body_content|>pizza, but not both. That's just plain mean.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>25. If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be  talking  
body_content|>about his choice of beer.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>26. Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a buddy of  yours,  
body_content|>except if she's withholding sex pending your response.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>27. Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while lifting  
body_content|>weights:  
body_content|>>a. Yeah, Baby, Push it!  
body_content|>>b. C'mon, give me one more! Harder!  
body_content|>>c. Another set and we can hit the showers!  
body_content|>>d. Nice Ass, Are you a Sagittarius?  
body_content|>  
body_content|>28. Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal  footing:  
body_content|>both urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other  situations, an  
body_content|>almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>29. Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than  you  
body_content|>are able to have sex with her. Keep a stopwatch by the phone;  Hang  
body_content|>up if necessary.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>30. When a buddy is trying to hook you up, you may sabotage him  only in  
body_content|>a manner that gives you no chance of getting laid either.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>31. You cannot rat out a coworker who shows up at work with a  massive  
body_content|>hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with  
body_content|>limburger cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he  
body_content|>thinks his monitor is broken, and have him paged over the  
body_content|>loudspeaker every seven minutes.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly "just a  friend"  
body_content|>have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling  weird and  
body_content|>guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion  about  
body_content|>what a big mistake it was.  
body_content|>  
body_content|>33. Always split aces and eights. No arguments.  
body_content|>
