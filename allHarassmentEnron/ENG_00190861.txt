body_content|i dont know why, but at first it felt a little awkward yesterday when we were going into my house.  it felt as though i was sneaking a boy into my room.  i hope i didnt make you feel uncomfortable.  i was so happy that you came by and that i was able to see you and hold you comfortably at last.  i guess i didnt really know how to react b/c my roommates were home.  dont get me wrong.  they are really awesome people.  they dont care who comes over.  i think it has been quite a while since i brought "male"company over though.  they probably would have been excited for me.  i think it was just me who was feeling strange.  i am really really close to my cousin shelly, but i dont really want her to know what is going on between us.  i guess i still feel somewhat awkward with you being married and all and then being at my house - and with things progressing as they are between us.  i just feel strange.   like this "feels right", but it "is not right".  i really enjoy being with you,  but i guess i'd be much more at ease if you were not attached.  i am sorry to mention this all over again.  i know it is the last thing you need to hear on a monday morning.  i dont know what your plans are - and you probably dont know what your plans for the future are as your marriage is concerned.  and you dont  need to answer me.  i am not asking for an answer or explanation - just venting i guess.   i hope you understand where i am coming from.   do you ever experience this?   this odd feeling that i am experiencing?

body_content|i dont know.  maybe i dont know what i am talking about.   maybe b/c "my little friend" is visiting i tend to be a little more sensitive than usual.   i feel so uncomfortable today - maybe that is more info than you need to know, right now.   sorry......i guess its a female thing.......  : - (

body_content|Hey what is going on?  How did you sleep last nite.  I didn't sleep well.  I had weird dreams.  Anyway, I had a wonderful time yesterday.  I hope you did as well.  You have a very nice room.  Everything a person needs.  A nice soft bed, a tv, a closet, a computer and a nice soft bed, oh did I mention that already, I guess that is on my mind.
