body_content|Two bored  casino dealers were waiting at a craps table.  A very attractive blonde  woman arrived and bet $20,000 on a single roll of the dice.
body_content|She said, "I  hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I'm completely  nude."
body_content|With that she stripped from her neck down, rolled the dice and  yelled, "Mama needs new clothes!"
body_content|Then she hollered..."YES! YES! I WON! I  WON!" She jumped up and down and hugged each of the dealers. With that she  picked up all the money and clothes and quickly departed.
body_content|The dealers  just stared at each other dumbfounded.
body_content|Finally, one of them asked, "What  did she roll?"
body_content|The other answered, "I thought YOU were  watching!"
body_content|Moral: Not all blondes are dumb, but most men are  perverts??????
