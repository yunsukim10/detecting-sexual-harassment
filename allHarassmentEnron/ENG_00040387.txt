body_content| > The following is from an actual 1950's Home Economics textbook
body_content|Intended
body_content| > for High School girls, teaching them how to prepare for married
body_content|life.
body_content| >
body_content|  > > 1.   HAVE DINNER READY: Plan ahead, even the night
body_content|before, to have a
body_content| > delicious meal - on time.  This is a way of letting him know  that
body_content|you
body_content| > have > been thinking about him, and are concerned about his needs.
body_content|Most
body_content| > men are hungry when they come home and the prospects of a good
body_content|meal are
body_content| > part of the warm welcome needed.
body_content|  > >
body_content|  > > 2.   PREPARE YOURSELF: Take 15 minutes to rest so you
body_content|will be refreshed
body_content| > when he arrives.  Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair
body_content|and be
body_content| > fresh looking.  He has just been with a lot of work-weary people.
body_content|Be a
body_content| > little gay and a little more interesting. His boring
body_content| > day may need a lift.
body_content|  > >
body_content|  > > 3.   CLEAR AWAY CLUTTER.  Make one last trip through the
body_content|main part of
body_content| > the house just before your husband arrives, gathering up
body_content|schoolbooks,
body_content| > toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your
body_content|husband will
body_content| > feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and it will give
body_content|you a
body_content| > lift too.
body_content|  > >
body_content|  > > 4.   PREPARE THE CHILDREN.  Take a few minutes to wash
body_content|the children's
body_content| > hands and faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if
body_content|necessary,
body_content| > change their clothes.  They are little treasures and he would like
body_content|to see
body_content| > them playing the part.
body_content|  > >
body_content|  > > 5.   MINIMIZE THE NOISE: At the time of his arrival,
body_content|eliminate all noise
body_content| > of washer, dryer, or vacuum.  Try to encourage the children to be
body_content|quiet.
body_content| > Greet him with a warm smile and kiss, letting him know you're glad
body_content|to see
body_content| > him.
body_content|  > >
body_content|  > > 6.   Some DON'TS: Don't greet him with problems or
body_content|complaints. Don't
body_content| > complain if he's late for dinner.  Count this as minor compared
body_content|with what
body_content| > he might have gone through that day.
body_content|  > >
body_content|  > > 7.   MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE.  Have him lean back in a
body_content|comfortable chair or
body_content| > suggest he lay down in the bedroom.  Have a cool or warm drink
body_content|ready for
body_content| > him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes.  Speak in
body_content|a low,
body_content| > soft, soothing and pleasant voice.  Allow him to relax and unwind.
body_content|  > >
body_content|  > > 8.   LISTEN TO HIM: You may have a dozen things to tell
body_content|him, but the
body_content| > moment of his arrival is not the time.  Let him talk first.
body_content|  > >
body_content|  > > 9.   MAKE THE EVENING HIS: Never complain if he does not
body_content|take you out to
body_content| > dinner or to other places of entertainment; instead try to
body_content|understand his
body_content| > world of strain and pressure and his need to be home and relax.
body_content|  > >
body_content|  > > 10.  THE GOAL: try to make your home a place of peace
body_content|and order where
body_content| > your husband can relax.
