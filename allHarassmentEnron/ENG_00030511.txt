body_content|> A lady approaches a priest and tells him, "Father, I have a problem. I
body_content|have 
body_content|> these two talking parrots, but they only know how to say one thing." 
body_content|> 
body_content|> "What do they say?" the priest asked. 
body_content|> 
body_content|> "They only know how to say, 'Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have 
body_content|> some fun?" 
body_content|> 
body_content|> "That's terrible!" the priest exclaimed." I have a solution for your
body_content|problem. 
body_content|> Bring your female parrots over to the rectory, and I will put them with my
body_content|
body_content|> two male parrots, whom I have taught to pray and read the Bible. 
body_content|> My parrots will teach your parrots to stop saying that terrible phrase, 
body_content|> and your female parrots will learn to pray and worship." 
body_content|> 
body_content|> The next day, the lady brings her female parrots to the rectory. The male 
body_content|> parrots are holding rosary beads and praying in their cage. 
body_content|> The lady puts her parrots in with the male parrots, and the females say, 
body_content|> "Hi, we're prostitutes! Do you want to have some fun?" 
body_content|> 
body_content|> One male parrot looks over at the other and squawks, "Put your beads 
body_content|> away, Frank, our prayers have been answered!"
