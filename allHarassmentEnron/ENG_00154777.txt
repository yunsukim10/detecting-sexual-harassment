body_content|OK, so I don't know all of you and many others are long estranged.  And
body_content|there's nobody estranger than Brewster!  Hey-oohhh!  Yes!
body_content|
body_content|Now that I have tickled your funny bone, I would like to tickle another
body_content|bone.  That bone is the one that is interested ushering our mutual friend,
body_content|Eric Ellwanger into blissful espousal.  We are throwing what the French
body_content|call "un party d' bachelor" for the bon bon homme.  (I do not speak French,
body_content|but I think that last bit rhymed.)
body_content|
body_content|I really do not have a lot of information yet, I just wanted to make sure
body_content|that everyone keeps the date open.  The main event is Saturday,  May 12th
body_content|(a week before the actual wedding).  But, I think we oughta make a weekend,
body_content|and then a week of it, since at least Eric and Adam will be free for the
body_content|entire week between the bachelor party and the wedding.  It will take place
body_content|in Houston, but naturally will have global repercussions.  Out of towners
body_content|and drunkards, don't worry about a place to stay, I've got lots of room.
body_content|
body_content|Oh, don't get too excited, but I might be able to get the KLF to perform.
body_content|They've got a hip new sound!
body_content|
body_content|In the meantime, I would love to hear any ideas you might have for themes,
body_content|party favors, and the like.  Maybe something to do with the Cardinals,
body_content|Hawaiian shirts, or malted milk.   Also, if you have any pictures, please
body_content|send those along, as the hosts will possibly be developing a website to
body_content|chronicle this event.
body_content|
body_content|Sincerely, Clay
