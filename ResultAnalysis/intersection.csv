the empty chair the empty chair a mans daughter had asked the local minister to come and pray with her father when the minister arrived he found the man lying in bed with his head propped up on two pillows an empty chair sat beside his bed the minister assumed that the old fellow had been informed of his visit i guess you were expecting me he said no who are you said the father the minister told him his name and then remarked i see the empty chair i figured you knew i was going to show up oh yeah the chair said the bedridden man would you mind closing the door puzzled the minister shut the door i have never told anyone this not even my daughter said the man but all of my life i have never known how to pray at church i used to hear the pastor talk about prayer but it went right over my head i abandoned any attempt at prayer the old man continued until one day about four years ago my best friend said to me johnny prayer is just a simple matter of having a conversation with jesus here is what i suggest sit down in a chair place an empty chair in front of you and in faith see jesus on the chair its not spooky because he promised ill be with you always then just speak to him in the same way youre doing with me right now so i tried it and ive liked it so much that i do it a couple of hours every day im careful though if my daughter saw me talking to an empty chair shed either have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny farm the minister was deeply moved by the story and encouraged the old man to continue on the journey then he prayed with him anointed him with oil and returned to the church two nights later the daughter called to tell the minister that her daddy had died that afternoon did he die in peace he asked yes when i left the house about two oclock he called me over to his bedside told me he loved me and kissed me on the cheek when i got back from the store an hour later i found him dead but there was something strange about his death apparently just before daddy died he leaned over and rested his head on the chair beside the bed what do you make of that the minister wiped a tear from his eye and said i wish we could all go like that just send this to four people and do not break this please prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive there is no cost but a lot of rewards i never said it would be easy i only said it would be worth it god netzero free internet access and email http www netzero net download index html,204101,1,0,1,0,0

admission visit thanks for the informative infomation session this past friday also thank you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application and talking to dr harris for me after meeting with many of the faculty and staff professors brown titman jemison ronn at the school my desire to attend the school is quite strong the school is a perfect fit for the career i am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where i would be able to contribute to and learn from the energy finance program due to my experiences with enron eventhough i have tested poorly on tests such as the gmat i feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that i have proven that i can successfully compete in a competitive environment ie enron i excel in environments team oriented such as described by the many people i talked with at the texas b school again thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and it was good to see someone from boston who lived in dc and was now living in texas such as myself regards ben rogers,23561,1,0,0,1,0
admission visit meg i would like to make sure that i have fully explained the reason for my gmat score if the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on this disability i can do that due to this disability the gmat score is not a good indicator of how i will do at ut through what i have learned in my work experiences with state street bank and enron i know that i will be able to successfully do the work that ut requires if you could let me know what i can do to further explain my gmat score i would greatly appreciate it if you think it would be better to talk to dr harris i will do that thanks again for taking the time to help me with this issue ben,23666,1,0,0,1,0
results professor titman i would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the mba program in the end the results were not favorable i understand that it is a competitive process but i felt that with my work experiences recommendations extrcurricular activities etc that this would help my chances and possibly compensate my disability after talking with you and professors ronn brown and jemison i was sure that ut was the right place to continue learning about energy finance i am still sure that ut is the place for getting an excellent graduate level education so i want you to know that i am going to do what ever it takes to get in next year i plan on taking a couple of graduate level finance courses at the university of houston this summer and fall to demonstrate to the admissions office that i can compete at this level i also plan on trying to retake the gmat test due to my disability this will be a monumental task but i am determined to prove to the admissions committment that i can do the work at the texas university graduate school of business also i would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an energy finance private equity fund at ut i know that with my industry wide and investment banking contacts that i can help raise capital for the fund i am very interested in energy finance and think that your idea is a very good thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me it has been a pleasure to meet with you and i hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future also if you think of anything else i can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year please let me know take care and hope to hear from you soon sincerely ben rogers end of signature end of signature end of signature end of signature end of signature end of signature,23728,1,0,0,1,0

el paso schedule for and extremely problematic this sheet is as complete as possible and i am worried about it due to the following circumstances the dispatch sheet that comes to real time was mw flat on sunday and llh on monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today the four corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between and from mw long to flat i tried to resolve the four corners schedules with psco who told me they did not have a purchase from epe in july i tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to enron each time lisa had a buy resale with pnm at four corners but that booked out and did not seem to match the long that i saw in the dispatch sheet i spoke with pete who assured me that the sale to psco was good for the summer i still was unable to resolve the mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule no epe representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules and i was referred by a dispatch person to call on saturday and speak to carlos when he came in at pm i was very uncomfortable doing this and so in my desperation called roger at home who after some discussion with steve at his home confirmed that the extrat flat sunday and llh monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on july i trust his assesment and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet between all of the preschedulers today at enron we have spent over hours dealing with the epe schedules today the sheet is as complete as i possibly can find justification for cara semperger west power scheduling,27107,1,0,0,0,1

new west power deal info confidential for internal distribution only the purpose of this e mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible i realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing my apologies for this hopefully this e mail will accomplish that goal a number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals as a result we havent been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check instead these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices we have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have we now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money we have received approval from the cash committee for purchases through december th i think and we will secure additional cash to continue on here are the procedures as i understand them if you have any questions or modifications please me an e mail or give me a call cash desk each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated on a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term next day to next week deliveries with that counterparty are in the money if the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point we are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location the cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate based on spot market prices of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to steve thome the cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to john postlethwaite via e mail the cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring john current marketing desk steve thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk the marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis the marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to steve hall christian yoder make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to steve hall christian yoder at the marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis we dont necessarily care who buys it but rather we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to steve thome deal entry the new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle after discussing the matter with stacey white she recommended entering the new deals in enpower as zero price non mtm with an annuity equal to the prepay amount we should enter notes into enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions this will allow settlements to match an annuity in enpower with prepay out the door it will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice im sure that ive missed something let me know regards tim,30485,1,0,0,0,1
columbia assignment tanya when the columbia purchase was done in january did the isda master between ena and columbia energy services corporation stay with columbia or come over to us the reason that i am asking is that they have sent ena a letter notifying us of columbias transfer of its rights under such master to the new power company so it seems as if they believe that that master was not part of our acquisition who in credit needs to be aware of this if in fact this master will be assigned to new power carol,31456,1,0,0,0,1

new draft jack enclosed is a new draft of the schedules marked against the previous draft i believe that this draft responds to most of the issues raised in your e mails just a few additional thoughts since we will be redoing all of the existing confirms to refer to this master i did not change the language that states that conflicts between the confirms and the agreement are resolved in favor of the confirm i think that the language as written works on the setoff language when we are the non defaulting party we can only pull in other agreements between our affiliates and inland so i dont see how this language would impact any agreements between ena and guaranty bank unless inland is the non defaulting party with respect to disruption fallbacks our view is that if the confirm specifies a fallback reference price that after postponement you would use that price if available i think that the language works as drafted on cash collateral the qualified institution concept only applies when the non posting party is a defaulting party or has a credit rating below the threshold otherwise the non posting party can hold the collateral and do whatever it wants to with it your are correct that in practice this cash gets commingled with corporate funds and swept into the partys bank account but there is no requirement taht it work that way we look forward to having a call with your group next week please e mail me with some days and times so that i can alert our people thanks carol st clair eb phone fax carol st clair enron com,32510,1,0,0,0,1

ubs enron plan quick moves on deal swiss bank enron to seek approval of deal from ftc justice department within five business days by alan clendenning ap business writer new york ap enron corp nyse ene http finance yahoo com q s ene d t news http biz yahoo com n e ene html will give up its crown jewel energy trading business to a swiss investment bank in return for a third of the divisions profits and experts expect the bank will try to remake the division with a new name and management documents filed in bankruptcy court tuesday show that ubs warburg a division of switzerlands largest bank wont pay anything upfront to acquire the trading operation or assume any enron debt traders and other employees deemed crucial to the divisions success will be kept on but the documents didnt specify whether top enron managers are among the group of workers that will be asked to stay some of those employees will be awarded bonuses from an million fund as an incentive to stay with the company and enron will supply million of the cash according to the documents filed in u s bankruptcy court in manhattan a spokesman for enron didnt immediately return a telephone message seeking comment about enrons future or the future of the trading operation ubs warburg spokesman david walker said his firm would not comment until after judge arthur j gonzalez decides whether to approve the deal a hearing is scheduled for friday key among the changes ubs warburg will probably make are a name change for the trading operation a decision to show top managers the door and the effort to retain the traders said mark baxter director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university i think those people will stay and theyll have a new boss he said as for top management almost everybody is a liability now enron officials have said that about of the divisions workers will be asked to stay on at offices in houston and court documents indicated that ubs warburg also wants to take over the divisions offices in portland ore toronto and calgary alberta enron itself will become a much smaller company because it received percent of its revenue from the trading operation and creditors are likely to demand the sale of other assets but the nature of the profit sharing agreement between enron and ubs warburg gives enron an opportunity to attempt to rebuild said charlie sanchez energy markets manager for gelber associates in houston under terms of the deal enron and its creditors will initially get percent of the new business pretax profits and ubs warburg the remainder the documents said after three years ubs warburg can begin to buy out some of those profit sharing rights and eventually buy the rights to all of the profits and after five years ubs can sell the business it all seems very much like an attempt at least to keep a string of hope alive that ubs wont in fact wont be interested in purchasing them and they will accumulate enough proceeds to revive themselves that they can become a rebranded phoenix sanchez said and in a statement a top enron official made it clear that the company hopes to eventually emerge from bankruptcy protection as a viable business concern this is an extremely positive deal for enron and its creditors that confirms the substantial value of enrons trading operation said enron chief financial officer jeff mcmahon we believe this is a first step among many towards an overall plan of reorganization and planned emergence from bankruptcy ubs warburg and enron will file for approval of the deal with the federal trade commission and the justice department within five business days hours after the documents explaining terms of the deal were filed in court the new york stock exchange delisted enron stock which sold for a year ago but have changed hands at no higher than since december in a statement the exchange said enrons securities are no longer suitable for trading on the nyse the move was due to the expected protracted nature of the companys bankruptcy process and the uncertainty at this time as to the timing and outcome of this process as well as the ultimate effect on the companys common shareholders the nyse said enron collapsed late last year amid revelations of complex partnerships used to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books and mask financial problems so it could continue to get cash and credit to run the trading business a creditors committee supports the deal with ubs warburg but other enron creditors have questioned it saying they want more information about how the agreement was reached and how the proceeds will be allocated some two dozen enron creditors had already filed objections to the sale before the selection was announced dissatisfied creditors will have days to appeal gonzalezs ruling the deal does not include existing contracts enron has to supply power valued at between billion and billion before its collapse late last year enron was the worlds largest energy merchant and the nations seventh largest company by revenue enron differed from competitors in its penchant for complex bets on everything under the sun advertising

research columnist its dj vu all over again as stocks of supply chain software vendors i technologies itwo manugistics manu and sap sap among others have climbed sharply in recent months these stocks were among the highest flyers at the height of the internet bubble and its fair to wonder if investors are slipping back into that old bugaboo irrational exuberance the surge in prices is based on a

principal analyst wall street strategies last year capped the worst two year stock tumble since and effectively eliminated all the hype and hope that mobilized individual investors during the late s although it is unlikely that the individuals who remain in the market continue to expect the returns of yesteryear investors probably still expect too much from the broad market today investors are understandably concerned about the market and are leery of chasing stocks however there will be a time during the year when youve just missed the boat as most missed it last year and im just as sure that something will test the resolve of the market an event or series of events that will send stocks tumbling however i think it is a big mistake for investors to wait for it or to wait for some type of testing of the bottom by the same token however i think it is still important to take profits and maybe be a little more flexible with stops i suspect that after two years of depression this market will still suffer from bouts of mental instability let those bi polar moments work for you there are tons of funds on the sidelines waiting to chase this market keep a steady head dont panic and stop

new proven method look a funny a new method how to bathe the cat thoroughly clean the toilet add the required amount of shampoo to the toilet water and have both lids lifted obtain the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom in one smooth movement put the cat in the toilet and close both lids you may need to stand on the lid so that he cannot escape caution do not get any part of your body too close to the edge as his paws will be reaching out for any purchase they can find the cat will self agitate and make ample suds never mind the noises that come from your toilet the cat is actually enjoying this flush the toilet three or four times this provides a power wash and rinse which i have found to be quite effective have someone open the door to the outside and ensure that there are no people between the toilet and the outside door stand behind the toilet as far as you can and quickly lift both lids the now clean cat will rocket out of the toilet and run outside where he will dry himself sincerely the dog,46237,1,0,0,0,1

true orange oct part jerry scarbroughs true orange the internet newsletter for the true texas longhorn faithful volume no october no what iffing in this one sooners turn longhorns every which way but loose the longhorns had their worst day during the mack brown era saturday in dallas and they picked a bad time to do it because unbeaten oklahoma scored on its first six possessions and for good measure ran a pass back for a touchdown too en route to a victory the sooners dominated the longhorns offensively defensively and on special teams they even won the halftime when a billy sims led relay team beat an eric metcalf led relay team qb josh huepel passed the longhorns to death and pound sophomore rb quentin griffin broke oklahomas school scoring record and longhorn fans hearts with six touchdowns in short it just wasnt a good day to be a texas fan in the cold damp cotton bowl or anywhere the loss dropped texas to for the season and in the big and gave the sooners a big boost in their drive toward national and big honors it also made this saturdays game with colorado in boulder the biggest game of the year this is a season on the brink it could go up or down remember that debacle with ucla that started the slide in john mackovics last year brown is made of sterner stuff and i think he can get this team back on track but he has to do it in a hurry one thing longhorn fans need to be very thankful about is that heupel is a senior he was absolutely awesome saturday and he probably will be the best all around quarterback the longhorns will face this year here even more briefly than usual is how the game went first quarter oklahoma won the toss and deferred texas took the ball and the sooners got the wind a false start penalty on the games second snap doomed that drive and forced a quick punt into the wind kris stockton got a good roll on the low kick to the ou heupel hit four of five passes to cover the yards in six plays to give ou a lead with left tb hodges mitchell made a great run after catching applewhites third down pass to pick up a ut first down but it was the only one in the first quarter on their second try the sooners went yards in plays and ran the score to with left a holding penalty on the kickoff forced texas to start frrom its another three and out series and punt out of the end zone gave the sooners a short field at the ut they were on the move again at the ut when the period ended second quarter the ut defense got a great leaping interception in the end zone from cb quentin jammer but it was disallowed and he was called for pass interference instead giving ou a first down at the they scored on the next play for a lead with left starting qb major applewhite almost connected with freshman wr roy williams for a yard completion but the officials ruled he lost the ball on the way down and it was ruled incomplete the horns couldnt make a first down and j t thatcher ran stocktons punt back yards to the ut a personal foul on the runback set them back to the but they scored in two plays for a lead with remaining chris simms came in at quarterback and hit williams for a first down but a delay of game penalty negated it and simms next pass was intercepted by ou lb rocky calmus who returned it for still another ou touchdown and a lead with remaining that brought applewhite back in and he hit wr montrell flowers for a nice gain on first down but an illegal motion penalty forced a punt the sooners scored again giving them a lead with left at this point ous offense had been so dominant that it had faced only seven first downs all day and had converted all of them texas offense meanwhile had one first down the ut offense finally came to life driving yards in seven plays to leave ou on top with left mitchell got the td from seven yards out on a pass from applewhite the sooners were driving again when the half ended it was their only drive in the first half that did not result in a td at the half ou led in first downs in rushing yardage and in passing yardage third quarter texas finally forced ou to punt quickly to start the second half but applewhite under a big rush threw an interception that was run back to the ut ou scored in two plays for a lead just deep simms came back in at qb and played the rest of the way ou again drove deep into texas territory but freshman de kalen thorntons sack of heupel forced the sooners to try a field goal and it went wide the sooners next td came after a fumble by wr montrell flowers at the ut that made the score with left then victor ike probably the swiftest of all the longhorns got loose on the kickoff and sooner db michael thompson caught him from behind at the ou it was an yard return but the horns lost four yards on two plays and were facing third and at the ou when the quarter ended fourth quarter a pass interference penalty against ou gave texas a first down at the mitchell got five yards then backup tb kenny hayter took an outside toss for the td to make it with left ou came right back for its final td driving yards primarily on runs by griffin number updated daily i update my number daily with football and football recruiting news the number is it costs a minute you must be to call coachs corner coach mack brown said sunday he accepts the blame for the big loss to oklahoma and he said the longhorns have to bounce back because they still have a season to play and a lot of goals to accomplish if they play up to their capabilities after reviewing the film i still stand by what i said yesterday brown said they outcoached us they outhustled us they outplayed us they totally dominated the game and when that happens it comes back to me its my fault but he said the team still has a chance to repeat as the big south champion last year we were in the big at this point were at the same spot as we were last season asked if he thinks the team has a chance to rebound and win the title again he said no question about that were far from out of anything we just had a poor poor performance yesterday in a game that was very important for us and our fans for me to just throw out the season because of that would be totally asinine he noted that oklahoma after its loss to texas last year beat texas a m the following week and stanford after giving up points to texas last year won the pac championship and rose bowl berth there is a lot of anger after a loss like this by our fans he said what i will do this week is not look at the paper i wont watch tv or listen to the radio ill be working hard all week trying to get us back on track he said he thought the longhorns were ready to give a good performance against the sooners but he said after three straight losses to texas the oklahoma players might have just been hungrier our seniors had a chance to beat oklahoma four straight times he said some of them were crying most of our younger players were in shock he said a loss like this one forces coaches to re evaluate everything well definitely go back and look very closely at everything were doing well try to simplify things he said some of the longhorn players played well but he said most of them played hard but didnt play well the defense had been playing so well for us he said it didnt even look like the same defense part of it was ou qb josh heupel he played great we had a lot of mental mistakes brown said we just played poorly and who knows why we played that poorly you guys will start looking at the things we should change the fans will start looking at the things we should change ive got to look at things that i think will work ive got to get them back on track asked if he thinks there is a chance the team could fall apart because of the loss to the sooners brown said this team wont fall apart its a very young team with a lot of heart a lot of class well go back to work to fix things simplify things he said the key thing is for him to be truthful with his players this week about the things they did wrong the things they did right and the goals the team still can accomplish this is a bad week to be going to boulder he said noting that colorado upset a m in college station last week we wont ever forget this ou game but we still have goals to accomplish were still in the race for the championship in our conference the players are embarrassed and i know im embarrassed but weve got to pull back together and get back to work weve got to go back and make sure we are fundamentally sound th anniversary this is the final issue of my th year of publishing true orange next week will be the first issue of my th year while this is not a happy occasion because of the football game my first issue was after a texas win over ou and ut is against the sooners since true orange began thanks to all of you for your continued support true orange observations this was one of those games where a team has to figure out what went wrong try to correct it and then forget it because a game like this can be a cancer that ruins a season remember ucla and mack brown wont ask for my suggestions on this and im sure he can figure it out for himself but if i were in his shoes here is what i would do right now give a royal chewing out to my players my assistants and myself because this game was an embarrassment to all longhorns then i would say there are a lot of games left to play and this game needs to be put on the shelf and the colorado game should be the start of a new season for a team with a lot of goals left to accomplish figure out the few things that have worked on offense and build future game plans around them by the same token id figure out the plays that havent worked and quit using them the two up the gut plays the horns used on their first two plays saturday for zero yards have been unproductive all year texas rarely has a running play outside the tackles but the sweeps usually work when they are tried id also ditch that sideline pass that travels yards for a potential yard gain or an interception for a td and start throwing downfield more often to open the game against oklahoma state the longhorns had a four yard run and two pass completions on their first three plays and didnt pick up a first down pick a qb and go with him each qb has to be nervous knowing that if he throws an interception hell be jerked quit being so predictable on offense example when the horns line up in a two back offense and the tailback goes in motion texas has passed or been sacked trying to pass of the time this season there has been one run by a ut fullback all year brett robins touchdown in mop up duty against osu that formation invites an all out blitz if the run isnt going to be a big part of the offense go to the shotgun with four wideouts as the basic formation it gives the quarterback a better chance to complete his passes as ou qb josh heupel demonstrated to near perfection saturday game notes oklahoma qb josh heupel one of the nations top passers had net yards rushing saturday which was more than the yards gained by the longhorns leading ground gainer tb hodges mitchell this was the second most one sided game in the series trailing only the oklahoma victory in in texas leads the series the sooners yards and first downs are both school records against the longhorns this was the fifth most one sided defeat in texas history the bottom are at chicago ucla houston at oklahoma oklahoma at kirksville at tcu at vanderbilt oklahoma miami baseball team starts practice the longhorn baseball begins fall practice wednesday with

davis they just whipped us they whipped us up front they whipped us at the linebacker level and they whipped us in the secondary you could put it a thousand different ways but we just got whipped ut defensive coordinator carl reese i feel honestly this is worse than ucla in you dont come out against a big rival and get beat like that you feel bad getting dominated in every aspect of the game texas defensive tackle casey hampton we didnt make plays their quarterback did a great job but weve got to make plays it doesnt matter how good he throws the ball youve got to go up and knock it our or something you have to make plays and we didnt ut free safety greg brown we heard all week how good the texas defense was but we knew we were a good team too we werent going to take anything from them and our goal was to go right at them thats what we did my getting the record was a by product of our offensive performance as a whole sooner running back quentin griffin after scoring a school record six touchdowns this was the worst butt kicking ive ever been involved in ou was more emotional than us without question this is really bad to get manhandled by your rival it doesnt get any worse than this ut sophomore quarterback chris simms we took a lot away from this game last year we were up early and were playing good football at the start but things didnt go our way in the end we wanted to play four quarters today against a very good football team and we did that for the most part ou quarterback josh heupel i was a little out of position but i knew what they were doing with their tendencies the guy looked at this receiver the entire way if he had looked me off and gone the other way then i would have been in trouble but i took a guess and i was right we had a great team

federal price limits backfire www sfgate com return to regular view federal price limits backfire some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps david lazarus chronicle staff writer wednesday july san francisco chronicle url http www sfgate com cgi bin article cgi f c a mn dtl officials in california and nevada after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap western power prices warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states the warnings were issued as california came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon and one day after the first ever rolling blackouts in las vegas forced energy hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning the two states are asking the federal energy regulatory commission to take a closer look at the so called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages we need some clarity to this order said oscar hidalgo a spokesman for the california department of water resources which is spending billions of dollars to keep the states lights on generators need to be held accountable he said the crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below market rates during periods of high demand some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost no ones going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum an energy industry association in menlo park ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect this means individual regions like california or las vegas could end up not having enough ackerman said it increases the threat of blackouts blackout alert canceled california authorities issued a blackout alert at p m yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels they canceled the alert about an hour later after finding additional supplies everyone in the west is fighting for megawatts said stephanie mccorkle a spokeswoman for the california independent system operator which oversees the states power network the golden states latest brush with lights out conditions came a day after nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting heavy power users such as the mgm grand and caesars palace to dim their lights don soderberg chairman of the nevada public utilities commission said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating mondays shortage were looking very closely at this he said there seems to be a potential for unintended consequences specifically soderberg said nevada is focusing on operators of older less efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishing under capped prices were going to see how the caps might have played into this he said the federal ceiling in western states excluding california is about per megawatt hour in california a percent surcharge is added because of the states credit risk bringing the price to just over ackerman at the western power trading forum said regional price controls have extended californias power crisis to neighboring states california sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus he said lawyers looking for loopholes california and nevada officials however said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output the generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes in the plan said hidalgo at the department of water resources unfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance for months federal regulators refused to impose price controls preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output monday california officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the federal energy regulatory commission in case of emergencies no one answered he said they were closed state officials tried again yesterday and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter they were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response e mail david lazarus at dlazarus sfchronicle com san francisco chronicle page a,91460,1,0,0,0,1
new west power deal info confidential for internal distribution only the purpose of this e mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible i realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing my apologies for this hopefully this e mail will accomplish that goal a number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals as a result we havent been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check instead these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices we have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have we now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money we have received approval from the cash committee for purchases through december th i think and we will secure additional cash to continue on here are the procedures as i understand them if you have any questions or modifications please me an e mail or give me a call cash desk each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated on a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term next day to next week deliveries with that counterparty are in the money if the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point we are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location the cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate based on spot market prices of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to steve thome the cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to john postlethwaite via e mail the cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring john current marketing desk steve thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk the marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis the marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to steve hall christian yoder make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to steve hall christian yoder at the marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis we dont necessarily care who buys it but rather we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to steve thome deal entry the new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle after discussing the matter with stacey white she recommended entering the new deals in enpower as zero price non mtm with an annuity equal to the prepay amount we should enter notes into enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions this will allow settlements to match an annuity in enpower with prepay out the door it will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice im sure that ive missed something let me know regards tim,91583,1,0,0,0,1

pueblo given the numbers we got from mark baldwin is this where we are the overall economics of the pipeline project have to be supported almost entirely by the new power plant at most we could assume maybe day of gas load from industrials near the airport and another x from kirtlands gas load this assumed load will ramp up over several years or longer depending on how long these folks existing contracts are and not be available immediately we know the bogey for pricing the electric contract for doe its probably kwh less to make it attractive or maybe less either way a low rate we now know the best case scenario for cost on the pipeline about mm in the configuration without the isleta lateral or the lateral over to the power plant maybe about mm total we dont have absolutely reliable info on electric transmission constraints from the proposed plant to palo verde so id suggest that for now we just assume that we would be unconstrained on power sales at palo verde are there alternative liquid markets available that might have better pricing ercot pub serv colorado im not entirely sure how you guys are looking at the overall economics but to my non business guy mind the following scenarios or something similar stick out as the key benchmarks that will decide whether the project makes sense a worst case assume we build a mw power plant i e assume no extra power to sell in spot market and assume we get the kirtland gas load but no additional gas load from the customers baldwin talked to if the rate for the gas line is the minimum rate that enron could live with based on our internal hurdle rates can we hit the doe target power price and have any left over i suspect this scenario is upside down should we look at two alternative configurations for the power plant combined cycle and simple cycle b mid case assume we size the power plant at mw or some similar size based on a turbine configuration that makes sense and that we sell the surplus power at palo verde prices less albequerque palo verde transmission costs again assume no incremental gas load except kirtland if the gas pipeline rate is set at the minimum rate enron can live with does the power plant make enough to make the project work c wildly optimistic case same as mid case except add baldwins gas load and start ramping in some estimated amount of additional gas load when nm gas restructuring kicks in in did i get the year right also start ramping in some estimated amount of high priced retail power sales to back out the palo verde spot sales at whatever year nm retail electric restructuring is expected to kick in also i think with optimistic assumptions like this does it make sense tino suggested a meeting to talk economics in detail around the first of may ideally well have a feel for the above relationships and the transmission constraint situation by then thanks df,99318,1,0,0,0,1

game against san francisco last weekend posting catches and yards receiving hell face a questionable indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in week so starting jackson this week is a solid option stephen davis rb was hu evos updated davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly hes averaged yards rushing over his last four games and is once again emerging as a reliable fantasy player give him the start in week against a denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games tony banks qb was free agent updated banks has played well of late throwing five touchdowns in his last three games hes got a good matchup this weekend against a denver team that can be beaten through the air but hes only worth considering in very deep fantasy leagues michael westbrook wr was third world countryman updated westbrook has been inconsistent this season but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games hell face a denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering rod gardner wr was baby blues updated gardner has been held in check in his last two games catching only three passes for yards he does have a favorable matchup this weekend against denver however so starting him is a good move az zahir hakim wr stl xtreme updated hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks so starting him on your fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right hell go up against a tough new england secondary in week ten so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues torry holt wr stl pumpdog updated holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals but hes only scored only three touchdowns this season hell face a tough new england secondary this weekend but hes still worth starting on your fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers isaac bruce wr stl cali bound updated bruce hasnt put up the huge fantasy totals this season but hes still one of the better wideouts in the league hell face cb ty law and the formidable new england secondary but hes still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers marshall faulk rb stl baby blues updated faulk had a huge game against carolina proving that he is still the best fantasy player in the league hes a must start every week and should post solid numbers in week against new england ernie conwell te stl xtreme updated conwell has had a few down weeks so starting him on your fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble with the lack of depth at tight end around the league however starting conwell is something many fantasy owners will have no choice but to do richard huntley rb car baby blues updated huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against san francisco but dont be surprised if he splits carries with nick goings avoid starting either back in week if at all possible donald hayes wr car free agent updated hayes had only two catches for yards last weekend against st louis hes been unreliable for fantasy owners this season so starting him is a real gamble wesley walls te car cali bound updated walls has b een held in check over the last three weeks but hes still one of the better tight ends in the league hes had some success against san francisco in the past so starting him is advisable muhsin muhammad wr car kmb express updated muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game catching six passes for yards against st louis hes had some success in the past against this weeks opponent san francisco so starting him is a decent move brett favre qb gb cali bound updated favre has been one of the best fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season hell face an atlanta team on sunday with a very vulnerable secondary so be sure to start favre this week bubba franks te gb the hillrods updated franks may not put up huge yardage numbers but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable fantasy player unless you have a better option on your roster franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis bill schroeder wr gb baby blues updated s ch roeder ankle is not listed on the nfl injury report and is expected to start on sunday against atlanta hes a solid play this week against atlanta whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like green bay reuben droughns rb det free agent updated droughns will likely split time with lamont warren in detroits backfield this weekend in james stewarts absence neither back has much fantasy value outside of deeper leagues and starting them is a huge gamble lamont warren rb det free agent updated warren will likely start in place of the injured james stewart on sunday against arizona hes split carries with reuben droughns and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger fantasy leagues more updates

format of credit risk reduction transaction agr christian liz asked me to forward a good template of the three way agreement for assignment termination of trades in a credit driven context underlying these transactions if epmi will emerge with trades with the substituted counterparty epmi needs to have a modernized master trading agreement with such party and sometimes the prospect of completing this type of transaction is incentive for a counterparty to modernize its paper do an eei with us i found also that the assigned confirmations needed to be reviewed closely to make sure that what epmi stepped into was equivalent to what was being terminated the confirmations themselves were sometimes amended as part of the transaction to make them conform to what epmi insists upon as to product definitions etc please feel free to come back to me with any questions you may have david different date may not match up exactly with the draft agreement above,107153,1,0,0,0,1

constellation rio nogales capacity lease agreement development article one of the responses by constellation pace to the firm transportation draft is the volume stipulated in article our position in the draft was that we had the right to refuse receipt of gas into the new lateral that is below mcf d the number was based upon our belief that the ultasonic meters that would be installed in the new pipeline had this value as its lower limit of accuracy upon further investigation however we have discovered that the value is actually higher tom cathy of hanover measurement indicates that hpl is willing to accept a pipeline velocity that is significantly below what most would consider standard industry practice for ultrasonics we would accept a minimum flow rate of feet per second at fps the minimum flow rate would be mcf d psig mcf d psig and mcf d at psig cathy points out however that the industry standard velocity would be fps at fps the minimum acceptable flow rate for our ultrasonic measurement would be mcf d psig mcf d psig and mcf d psig our hydraulics indicate that to meet the rio nogales power plant minimum inlet pressure of psig the minimum receipt pressure at prarie lea to meet full load requirements from either hpl or oasis would need to be psig at pg e it would be psig based upon the above facts i recommend that we change our requirement in article to be mcf d psig please review and comment,132264,1,0,0,0,1

in re f j representation bob and i just spoke with steve susman i tried to mention the points you asked here are his comments f j probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with arthur anderson susman believes that there is a hot potato rule that prevents f j from doing so that being said susman doesnt care if f j represents arthur anderson or anyone else potentially adverse to us in the actions he is handling susman would not however agree to a broad advance ethical waiver as proposed by f j he does not believe such waivers are effective susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who f j wanted to represent i dont know whether f j would agree to this or not susman recognizes that we cannot force f j to take on the new mariner matter and that this is ultimately a risk benefit decision for us to make and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldnt agree to parenthetically i have received no comments on f js proposed waiver letter under the circumstances from his standpoint bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with f j but that if f j wont budge that we take something along the lines of what they have given us bob let me know if i have mischaracterized your thoughts from my standpoint i unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed this would be to the extent that the letter purports to have enron corp agree to bind all the enron entities and to the extent that it involves enrons agreement to what will happen after the dynegy merger as i set out in my earlier e mail my recommendation would be as set forth in my earlier e mail that only the enron entities currently being represented by f j sign it and be bound by it and to remove the language regarding what enron would agree to after the dynegy merger i also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made i do not know whether f j would be willing to make these changes or not our biggest problem right now is time management i know that mariner wanted to make a decision by today as to who to use i am willing to confer with dutton asap to see what f j would agree to and if he can agree in principle to send him a proposed draft agreement i believe he is out of the office but is checking his voice mail please let me know what you want me to do britt,144724,1,0,0,0,1

icap fine i still think that any obligation is a mistake just improving a bad market is not going to help make sure that dan allegretti is in the loop nepool is putting something like this together jim icap i know anyway the single most important issue from the perspective of retail seems to be daily granularity we need to be able to adjust our daily obligation based on customer switching patterns these can occur at any time so any thing that locks in our capacity requirement for a long period of time months to a year or more can be a killer a specific model we discussed was operating capacity this takes the operating reserves concept and blows it up to a full capacity market equivalent iso administers the market generators commit capacity to energy market or reserve market but not both long term deals possible as well as real time market lots has to be flushed out but it seems like a viable approach will discuss more on wednesday have talked briefly with luiz about this icap harry enron can never take the position that icap is good i dont know why stoness is trying to undertake more analysis his reasoning that icap is complicated and we do well at complications is crazy given the ees business model enron direct let me know how it is going jim icap kingerski harry we can meet today at pm in room to discuss more about retails view of icap and related issues scott stoness summary of our meeting yesterday with dale furrow his regional leads and narsimha misra the gist of the meetings was pro icap was pragmatically high energy costs are bad because they delay competition icap is therefore good because it reduces the high price periods with market intervention pragmatically icap is complicated and complicated translucent rules favor the bright enron mathematically separate markets capacity and energy should result in the same outcome ie energy costs should reduce to exactly offset the increase in demand charges theorectically if the market expects the government to intervene in the event of high power costs suppliers will build less capacity than needed given that this is inevitable government intervention we might as well intervene now as later theorectically market failure is probable because small customers are not able to internalize the costs of not hedging causing them to take more risk than they should given that the customers are not making the right societal decision we should make it for them pro not icap was any artificial price determination will distort the market causing inefficiencies ie a fixed icap for months will favor a technology available all year round ie icap could cause environmental damage by causing cts to be built instead of combined cycle icap with market is complicated which will decrease market efficiencies market prices with financial firm obligations will result in a continuous balance of supply and demand market prices will result in much more efficiency because they cause more demand side response conclusion there was no consensus there seemed to be more people on the no icap side than the icap side basically comes down to i economics suggests icap is inefficient vs ii lack of icap will damage competition we agreed that if icap is inevitable we should advocate market determined icaps we agreed that given that this issue is controversial and that narshima has the largest interests he should head up our response scott,146248,1,0,0,0,1

pge imbalance charge think the best thing is to let it ride no sense in discussing because we dont have a solution for them see if any intelligence on how hard they are going to push npco to fight us jim pge imbalance charge im going to carson city tomorrow i thought i could present the following message to the commissioners contracts were negotiated in a bilateral market at arms length nobody was requiring npco to do business with us similar contracts were upheld by the alj in the pnw refunds case youre going to completely screw up forward markets and npcos ability to contract in the future think of the risk premium that will attach to future contracts we tried to be the good guy with npco by offering a more comprehensive solution for them numerous times now were getting attacked for their mistakes we have met with npco a number of times to try and resolve this issue but the resolution requires that they post collateral now they wont even talk with us the only way you pucn are going to fix this is if you step up and require the utilities to post collateral when necessary however after talking with steve hall i concluded that it would be unwise at this point for me to contact the commissioners we dont have anything to offer and very little new to say for example according to steve we wont touch a blend and extend because of credit problems this said he was uncomfortable saying that the entire issue was collateral pge imbalance charge trying to put something together jim pge imbalance charge always by the way did you have further thoughts about a call to develop a comprehensive nevada strategy pge imbalance charge are we still friends pge imbalance charge thanks i hate it when i sound petulant pge imbalance charge my fault for not making it clear that you should have been in the loop we will send out a message across the board to help with this jim pge imbalance charge this is going to sound like empire building but i need to know what were doing with pge i dont need to participate in the calls but i do need to know the pge folks need to have confidence that im aware of our positions and plans pge imbalance charge we are having a conference call tomorrow with pge they did not decide anything on the last conference call after i told them why enron retail in the east likes the duquense type imbalance no bandwidth thus no penalties imbalances settle at verifiable system lambda john malowney of epmi west desk likes the bandwidth but we are discussing it further since it has created problems for the east ees desk due to the penalties associated with being outside the bandwidth john likes the pge proposal to settle at an index price but pge is reconsidering that aspect unfortunately i dont know of any tps that allow a bandwidth without penalties let me know if you want to participate in the call pge imbalance charge christi whats the latest on the pge imbalance method jim,146468,1,0,0,0,1

ej summary mike jeff we have updated the business summary form that you asked me for yesterday in addition to your requests we have included estimates for business liquidation costs as you will see there is very little difference mm between our assumed scaled down top team costs for and the costs to liquidate the business mm given that we are seeing deal flow and transactions after less than year with egm in a brand new market we would expect to break even for if this is then compared to the liquidation costs i believe an obvious question to shutdown would be why mm difference assuming no earnings for and we will make earnings my experience at enron with startup businesses usually entails investment the first year break even the second and break out the third i believe we are on track to do this the head start from other competitors the state of the japanese market and the demand for risk mgt products further underscores the value in the proposition it has been sometime since either you or jeff have been over to japan and allowed us to give you a full business review a lot has changed over this period we had hoped to do this with jeff but events of the last week have clearly overshadowed and precluded this while i understand everyone is trying to gain clarity as soon as possible i believe that it is imperative that japan be given a chance to present its case over the next weeks i am fully prepared to visit houston and demonstrate the clear case for this business as a prime marketing origination vehicle for japan and asia with clear options to develop a local trading presence i look forward to speaking with you further about this joe,161268,1,0,0,0,1

terra systems terra systems pink sheets tsyi latest price cents take a close look at terra systems pink sheets tsyi latest price cents which has just released the following news the group behind tsyi is the same people who put together etgp when they got involved in etgp the stock was trading at a similar price cents it lifted to cents in a short period of time etgp did a for reverse not needed in tsyi so that it traded in july of on the bulletin board the stock went to in september of and split two for one the whole transaction took less than a year terra systems inc announces positive assessment of its technology by scientific consulting group payson utah oct terra systems inc pink sheets tsyi announced today that a santa fe nm based scientific consulting firm the la mancha company has completed an initial study commissioned by tsyi about the companys patented pneumatic accelerator technology the title of the report is dry bulk materials handling technology with emphasis on coal the reports conclusions are positive concerning tsyi technologys technical and economic feasibility in part because tsyi is still a development stage company la manchas report cites certain caveats including that these general conclusions must be adequately measured and documented in rigorous pilot test environments such as those proposed by tsyi the summary statement of the la mancha report says in conclusion the process and its potential application to utilization in coal fired power generation the recovery of usable coal fines from long accumulating waste sites and its environmentally friendly attributes constitute an intriguing and innovative approach to assisting in reconciling the current dichotomy of energy demand and environmental concern the proposed phase i program of terra systems should be supported as a first step commenting on this study clayton timothy chairman of tsyi said we are very pleased with the positive conclusions about our technology that this report has reached the la mancha company is a prestigious scientific consulting firm and in this case two of the authors of the report hold ph d s in relevant physical sciences and are also retirees from the los alamos national laboratory we recognize the challenges tsyi faces in achieving successful commercialization including those mentioned in this report but we also feel this study provides substantial professional support for the faith we have in the scientific and economic efficacy of the companys unique process for dry bulk materials handling terra systems inc was incorporated in utah in and is presently a development stage company it is primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of its patented pneumatic accelerator this device is a gas linear particle accelerator which conveys and processes bulk materials at high velocity in a particle isolated state using air as the medium of movement this technology operates efficiently at ambient temperatures and at low pressures and does not use water the generally more costly traditional alternative for processing bulk materials virtually all organic and inorganic bulk materials used in basic industries can be more economically separated and classified by our dry process technology this capability facilitates a number of associated procedures including drying micro pulverizing mixing forming conveying and loading in addition bulk materials can be beneficiated in important ways including moisture reduction ash reduction btu enhancement and electro customization our system can perform multiple tasks needs less maintenance requires no chemical additives and can improve the surrounding environmental quality opportunities are seen for many applications in an array of large industries including power generation agriculture mining environment construction ceramics and materials transportation we estimate that our technology could generate economic returns to industrial users in the form of revenues

california senate formally withdraws contempt actions against enron yesterday we reached agreement with the senate regarding the terms and conditions under which the company would provide information to senator dunns committee investigating wholesale price spikes in return dunn agreed to have is committee formally withdraw all contempt actions against enron this morning dunn convened his committee and the committee formally withdrew the contempt actions a story related to the deal is attached if you have any questions just let me know best jeff end of signature contempt articles enron agrees to provide files averts senate contempt finding by emily bazar bee capitol bureau published sept state lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against enron corp on thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately the last minute wrangling between enron and a special senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in following hours of closed door meetings enron signed an agreement in the early evening allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full senate and the possibility of stiff fines under the deal enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over it took too long to bring this to resolution said state sen joe dunn d santa ana who chairs the committee i cant help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt as part of the deal however enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in july asking the court to intervene on its behalf said spokeswoman karen denne she said the company is still considering its options were pleased theyve agreed to withdraw the contempt charges denne said enron and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them had been found in contempt in late june after it refused to turn over documents violating subpoenas that the committee issued on june the subpoenas called for documents of all kinds including those with specific details prices quantities and capacity of the companies transactions in the states wholesale electricity market enron officials balked at the request saying they didnt want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets ultimately the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the senate thursday morning the senate rules committee met to consider the committees contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full senate along with suggested punishments in the form of fines after an hour of finger pointing and confusing allegations senate president pro tem john burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences at p m enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies in addition the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities including the sacramento municipal utility district smud was among municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents the bees emily bazar can be reached at or ebazar sacbee com mailto ebazar sacbee com enron and state reach agreement on papers the power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market september by kimberly kindy the orange county register sacramento enron corp signed a confidentiality agreement late thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a senate investigation into the california electricity market the compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations at stake for enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines the senate rules committee on thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full senate to hold enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents while delaying the decision senate leader john burton d san francisco ordered attorneys from the legislative counsel of california a senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets lets hope cooler minds prevail said rules committee member sen ross johnson r irvine as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting the contempt proceedings for now have been dropped said sen joe dunn d santa ana who chairs the senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late thursday the state senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nations two largest public employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the legislature the legislative counsel of california is recommending the action it is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the california legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of california said dunn who asked for the counsels review and recommendation enron agrees to turn over documents to senate investigators by jennifer coleman associated press september sacramento enron corp agreed thursday to release company documents to a senate committee investigating possible price manipulation ending the committees quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena the senate rules committee heard arguments from enron and the senate select committee to investigate price manipulation of the wholesale energy market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt in june the select committee subpoenaed enron files as part of its investigation into record high prices in the states wholesale electricity market enron sued to quash the subpoena a motion a judge rejected the judge agreed however that enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information sen joe dunn d santa ana chairman of the select committee said late thursday that enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators with that agreement dunn said the committee would withdraw a report that recommended enron be found in contempt he said he expects documents to be transferred immediately dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee it was in contempt he asked sen john burton d san francisco chairman of the rules committee to approve fines against enron for each day they didnt comply with the subpoena the daily fines would start at doubling each day for days then the company would be fined million a day enron lawyer michael kirby said the company had put nonconfidential documents in a depository in sacramento so committee investigators could review them but dennis murphy a lawyer for the select committee said enron didnt tell investigators where the depository was located the committee discovered the address in documents filed by enron for the court case he said weve been trying to get into the depository for a week they have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there he said kirby disputed that and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents the two parties havent met since the judge ordered the protective order and kirby said it was the

power providers cry foul over fees cal iso dwr price manipulation power providers cry foul over fees state is accused of improper billing electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating californias energy market are turning the tables on the state saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by gov gray davis administration the power traders accuse the independent system operator which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high priced electricity contracts energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency said jan smutney jones of the independent energy producers association which represents such industry giants as enron dynegy williams and reliant the charges showed up around the time the state department of water resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of per megawatt hour for as little as per megawatt hour the iso seems to be following specific instructions the department of water resources is giving them smutney jones said an industry source said nrg energy inc and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the federal energy regulatory commission which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged the commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency state officials bought power under long term contracts when it appeared california could suffer serious power shortages over the summer instead the state had more than enough power and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy california had bought gary ackerman of the western power trading forum an industry group said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to bury some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators the state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity and they control the governing board of the iso ackerman said the governors spokesman steve maviglio called the power firms accusations absolutely false and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in washington to interfere with the states affairs the generators know theyll get a much better deal at ferc headquarters in washington than they will in sacramento maviglio said it shouldnt be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement oscar hidalgo a spokesman for the department of water resources said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in californias energy crisis i dont feel sorry for them one bit hidalgo said they had one heck of a year gregg fishman spokesman for the iso said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations energy trade organizations said they suspected the iso of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs the extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers bills for iso operating costs which all electricity sellers in california share ackerman said some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand by power units on too short notice when they cant comply they say the iso brings high priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost the accusations are part of a struggle for control of californias grid in january davis disbanded the isos member governing board which was chaired by smutney jones after some critics said it was too cozy with industry davis appointed his own five member board in february then ferc chairman curt hebert said the new board had become a political arm of the governor the commission is trying to get california to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization davis has warned washington to keep its hands off the iso,163034,1,0,0,0,1

pennfutures e cubed pittsburgh a golden opportunity for renewable energy pennfutures e cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market if you have trouble reading this email please see the document on our website www pennfuture org under pressroom publications august vol no pittsburgh a golden opportunity for renewable energy the end of large stranded cost charges to consumers will usher in a golden opportunity next year for the pittsburgh area to become the renewable energy capital of america in the duquesne light service territory in rates for some customers approached percent above the national average with residential customers paying more than cents per kilowatt hour kwh of this cents plus total about cents was for just generation and what did consumers get for this premium cents generation price well above any price including for todays percent renewable energy products seen in pennsylvanias competitive retail market since did they get clean and safe energy not unless you believe that coal and uranium are renewable resources in fact the pittsburgh area was powered by incredibly expensive nuclear plants that often were shut down more than they ran as well as some of the highly polluting coal plants that kill pennsylvanians each year with microscopic dirt cause acid rain produce smog and contribute to global warming both the pollution and the high costs were jammed down the throats of consumers by monopoly friendly regulators those who challenged the legacy of high rates and dirty power and asked the old pennsylvania monopoly utilities about renewable energy were often lectured that renewable energy technology would cost more or was not practical todays competitive retail market shows how wrong those lectures were right now in pittsburgh four competitive suppliers two are green e certified are offering percent renewable energy products for prices ranging from cents to cents per kwh those prices are less than the cents duquesnes customers paid for coal and nuke generation five years ago in fact they are more than a full cent less per kwh since renewable energy products exist in the marketplace are exponentially cleaner and cost less than duquesnes traditional power products why have they so far not swept the marketplace can you say stranded costs or competitive transition charges customers who switch to renewable energy products pay not just the price of the product but also a regulatory stranded cost charge of up to cents per kwh on a system average basis the stranded cost charge is percent of each customers total electric bill and for residential customers it is a whopping percent of the total electric bill the stranded cost charge is paid even if you switch from duquesne light to another company and allows duquesne to recover uneconomic investments in nuclear power made when it was a regulated generation monopoly without the collection of stranded cost charges duquesne may have gone bankrupt yet adding the stranded cost charge to the otherwise less costly renewable energy products has the effect of increasing a customers total bill when s he bought renewable energy products thus stranded cost charges are a real barrier to renewable energy products and other competitive retail electric products but in in the duquesne light service territory the regulatory ball and chain of stranded cost charges will be eliminated by giving a large total rate cut of probably percent to all residential customers and by increasing the shopping credit from cents to about cents for residential customers the removal of stranded cost charges means many pittsburgh area customers will soon be able to switch to renewable energy products and pay less or no more than what they were paying for electricity in yes they could save even more by buying even lower cost dirty power products but the coming opportunity to power pittsburgh with renewable energy and pay less than bills is a once in a century chance the duquesne transition the reason why duquesne will be the first pennsylvania utility to eliminate stranded cost charges is its successful sale of its generation plant duquesne first swapped some generating assets with firstenergy and then sold all of its generating assets to orion while contracting with orion to continue to provide default service to duquesnes native load customers duquesne has provided distribution service and orion has provided default generation service at capped rates without notable problems without a former monopoly utility with a vested interest in keeping generation customers a far greater portion of customers switched to a competitive supplier than anywhere else in the u s competitive suppliers now serve about percent of all duquesne customers the number of duquesne customers served by competitive suppliers rose steadily until peaking in late at about held steady through spring and then declined to about as of july the recent decline occurred when retail offers exceeded the systems shopping credit but remained well below duquesnes generation rate of cents today there are four competitive suppliers offering six different products to residential customers in the duquesne territory one of which is priced below the shopping credit and enables customers to switch and save and four of which are renewable energy products recent sharp declines of more than percent in forward electric markets make it likely that more products will soon be able to beat the current duquesne shopping credit of cents and of course the cent monopoly rate after the two remaining principal impediments of completing a successful transition to competition in the duquesne light service territory will be the full integration of its control area and wholesale market into pjm and wide deployment of demand response technologies time of use meters and appliance control devices allow customers to profit from reducing usage in summer peak hours protect reliability reduce market power and can lessen pollution the failure to achieve pjm integration and demand response could derail the benefits of stranded cost elimination and what has been so far a successful transition for the duquesne service territory no more stranded costs stranded cost charges will likely be first removed for residential customers starting in march up until now average system customers have had to pay cents on every dollar paid for total electric service so that duquesne could recover its stranded costs with the end of stranded cost charges different classes of customers and different individual customers depending on their usage will receive a substantial rate cut current prices for electric service from duquesne light rates in cents kwh rs rate gs gl distribution transmission generation ctc portion of gen shopping credit total the portion of the bill that is the competitive transition charge represents the basic rate reduction that each class will enjoy when the charges are terminated the charges are scheduled to end in march for general residential customers rs april for smaller commercial customers gs and september for larger commercial customers gl the charges end for other customer classes as late as april residential customers using kwh month for example will stop paying cents kwh for stranded costs reducing their total electric bill by percent real market prices generation rates will still be regulated for customers receiving default generation service under duquesnes contract with orion however the rates will no longer reflect the remnants of pre restructuring cost of service rates instead they will be based imprecisely on market rates when the puc approved the sale of duquesnes generating plants and the transfer of the default service to orion it approved tentative default rates at market prices as determined by the duquesne contract with orion the precise level of default rates remains unknown however consumers would see total rate reductions of about percent if the default rate is set at cents kwh and a total rate cut of percent if it is pegged at cents again these default rates are well below the cent monopoly rate although the duquesne orion contract set and the puc approved the default rates the rates did not assume that duquesne would be joining pjm west there have been some non public discussions taking place between the puc orion and duquesne as well as some public discussions but at this point it is unclear whether the existing rates should or will be adjusted whatever the precise answer the puc needs to move these proceedings to the public domain and resolve the issues expeditiously so that customers and suppliers may plan to take advantage of the new market opportunities competitive market opportunities in the shopping credit will increase for customers who choose to buy generation from a competitive supplier instead of orions default service given reasonable assumptions about market prices and what the shopping credit may be it appears that competitive suppliers will have substantial opportunities to provide competitive service at prices below the shopping credit for example if the present residential shopping credit of cents kwh is raised to cents kwh as presently scheduled consumers would have a modest opportunity to save by shopping in addition to the savings that all customers including those remaining on default generation service will experience from the end of stranded cost charges if the residential shopping credit is increased to about cents kwh suppliers competing on price would have a substantial opportunity to offer consumers meaningful savings by shopping one might presume that the percent of all customers already shopping in the duquesne service territory include many of those most interested in shopping will the opportunity to save a bit more after receiving a percent rate decrease without shopping be sufficient to entice many of the remaining customers to shop setting the rate too low will provide a disincentive to shop by delivering even more savings to non shopping customers who already will be getting a huge rate cut because of the end of the stranded cost charges given that market rates are a prediction that no one has been making accurately perhaps the puc should err on the high side to increase competitive market opportunities there is no better time for doing so than when all customers are about to receive a huge rate cut from the elimination of stranded cost charges renewable energys time is now even moderate additional shopping based on price does not mean a non competitive market however perhaps the most successful competitive suppliers will be those that offer products or services that encourage customers to switch for reasons other than price renewable energy energy efficiency and demand side response products may well provide suppliers with the competitive edge the opportunity for renewable energy market penetration is in fact unprecedented two new wind farms are under construction at this time in somerset and fayette counties bringing the total installed wind capacity in the region to about megawatts mw two additional wind farms are under development in the same area and another is under development about miles across the state line in west virginia potentially bringing an additional mw of wind power to serve the pittsburgh market depending on the precise shopping credit it is likely that wind electricity from these developments could be sold to retail customers at prices close to or not too far above the shopping credit even if buying renewable energy is not the lowest cost option consumers would still be investing a portion of their percent rate cut in renewable generation and still receive a reduction in their electric bill from what is now paid for example a residential customer could buy one of the five renewable products presently available to consumers in the duquesne territory and still save from cent to cents per kwh alternatively consumers probably will be able to buy percent wind energy and still receive a total electric bill more than percent less than it is today and was in large institutions government agencies businesses and families can without increasing their current electricity bills become renewable energy

facing a looming deadline and pressure from the governor legislative leaders said thursday they will push for a vote next week on a revised plan to save southern california edison from bankruptcy court under competing proposals from each house of the state legislature large businesses would pay for the majority of edisons billion debt and power generators would be pressed to accept less than they are owed for past energy purchases a vote next week would come three months after gov gray davis first struck an agreement with edison his original arrangement would have the state purchase the companys transmission lines for billion and use a portion of consumer rates to help pay off edisons debt but lawmakers roundly criticized the democratic governors agreement in subsequent weeks and floated alternatives soon afterward lawmakers acknowledged that the latest alternatives are still under negotiation the governors agreement with edison has an aug deadline which falls toward the end of the legislatures summer recess because the monthlong break is scheduled to begin next friday lawmakers plan to vote before then the assembly could vote on a proposal as early as saturday davis on tuesday threatened to call a special session to keep legislators in sacramento if they do not approve the edison plan before the break but senate president pro tem john burton d san francisco challenged that threat saying only the legislature can keep the legislature here senate democrats are studying a plan by sen byron sher d palo alto that would have large businesses pay off most of edisons debt and force generators to reduce by percent the amount they are owed by the utility that would leave about billion in debt for which edison itself would be responsible without relying on ratepayers sher said his plan also gives the state the option to purchase edisons transmission lines for book value less than half the price davis offered to pay burton said his house will vote on a version of shers proposal next week burton said he prefers shers version because large businesses and industrial users not consumers or small businesses would be responsible for paying the majority of edisons debt he reiterated that businesses were among the most ardent advocates for electricity deregulation were trying to do something legislatively that protects the people and isnt a bailout for the utility burton said i dont think its fair that small users pay for any of the debt while the senate toils over shers proposals members of the assembly are drafting their own version of a plan their version too would separate users into large and small categories according to paul hefner a spokesman for assembly speaker robert hertzberg d sherman oaks under the plan electricity for small users some residential and small business customers would come from the cheapest sources edisons own power plants and renewable energy sources known as qualifying facilities larger users would pay more because they would obtain power from the long term contracts that have been signed by the state department of water resources ultimately as the amount of electricity supplied by the long term contracts declines over the course of several years and the overall supply increases costs to large businesses are expected to decline as they buy more power on the open market presumably at lower prices the plan envisions a portion of business and residential rates dedicated to reducing edisons debt for at least the first year with businesses picking up more of the burden in future years like the senate plan the state would have an option to buy transmission lines the bees kevin yamamura can be reached at or kyamamura sacbee com mailto kyamamura sacbee com no outcry to ease clean air process by chris bowman bee staff writer published july the bush administration did not receive much sympathy from california at a hearing thursday about its concerns that some environmental rules make it hard for industry to meet demands for electricity and gasoline no owners of california power plants testified in sacramento at the second of four public hearings examining whether clean air rules unnecessarily impeded energy production president bush ordered the day review by the u s environmental protection agency in may as part of his national energy policy as for californias gasoline producers a few representatives called for streamlining and clarifying the epa rules but not relaxing them at issue are federal clean air act regulations collectively called new source review that apply to businesses looking to build or expand refineries power plants and other sites that generate air pollution the rules call for installation of the best available pollution control hardware plus smog cutting measures that more than offset the added air emissions californias smog officials saw the lack of industry protest thursday as evidence that rules do not need major fixing the system is working peter venturini a state air resources board official said at the hearing which was attended mostly by industry representatives and environmentalists venturini said smog forming emissions from businesses in the state have declined percent the past years despite a percent increase in population and commensurate industry growth that tells us we can have a healthy economy and protect our environment he said that balance has been put to the test during the states energy crisis venturini testified to epa officials thursday that californias fast tracked system of permitting new power plants within days shows that new source rules can be flexed to meet a sudden thirst for more energy several industry representatives said the clinton administration had interpreted the rules in confusing ways that inhibited even routine plant maintenance and upgrades some of which improved efficiency and cut emissions of pollutants worse they said state and local regulators of the rules would impose their own often conflicting interpretations of the rules a system in which different agencies reach different conclusions from the same set of facts is no system at all said shannon broome spokeswoman for the air permitting forum a national coalition of manufacturers seeking to streamline the rules environmentalists argued the bush administration was exploiting the california energy crisis to roll back environmental regulations at the expense of public health they said any relaxation would result in thousands of premature deaths of heart and respiratory patients priscilla

by dale kasler bee staff writer published july thwarted in their quest for an billion refund from wholesale power suppliers state officials began applying political pressure thursday on federal regulators who will set refund levels a month after pressure from congress prompted the federal energy regulatory commission to accept price controls on electricity house democrats from california urged ferc to support gov gray davis refund demands the congressional delegation is doing all it can rep sam farr head of the states democratic delegation told reporters during a conference call with davis farr called billion a reasonable refund recommending a more lenient standard for calculating refunds the democrats said in a letter that ferc should order refunds for power sales dating back to may ferc however has ruled previously that it cut off the refund period at oct the state says about one third of the alleged overcharges or nearly billion took place between may and october meanwhile a ferc administrative law judge reiterated his belief that the refunds would total hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billion dollars but less than the billion california says it was overcharged judge curtis wagner who oversaw two weeks of negotiations between california and the suppliers said the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated in a report to ferc commissioners he repeated his earlier comment that the state owes more to the suppliers for unpaid power bills than the suppliers owe the state for overcharges on thursday wagner formally recommended that ferc hold a public hearing to calculate the overcharges in setting the guidelines for figuring out refunds wagner said the calculations should be tied to production costs a guideline urged by californias negotiators but the judge included a guideline likely to favor the sellers for sales taking place after jan the sellers can add percent to their cost calculations as a risk premium that was the date pacific gas and electric co and southern california edison were placed on junk bond status by wall street credit rating agencies making sellers reluctant to deliver power to the two utilities the state stepped in two weeks later to buy power for pg e and edison davis speaking to reporters before wagners recommendation said the judges cost formulas would help california prove his case the number comes up close to billion he said but the governor who has threatened to sue ferc if he didnt get billion suggested hell need political help from congress to get his way with ferc it is widely believed that political pressure made ferc abandon its free market orientation last month and place price controls on wholesale electricity prices throughout the west

later that most of the reports had not been filed until thursday he said administration lawyers were investigating any possible conflicts if theres anything inappropriate individuals will be dealt with he said one energy trader reported holding stock in enron corp several energy schedulers reported owning stock in calpine another power generator including one who reported holdings valued between and million jones said the democratic governor should have known such financial interests were unacceptable clearly if you have any type of asset involvement you have a potential conflict he

sacbee com judge says california owed hundreds of millions of dollars not billions objattph by jennifer coleman associated press july sacramento an administrative law judge mediating talks between the state of california and energy companies says the state is likely owed hundreds of millions of dollars in refunds much less than the billion the state wants judge curtis l wagner jr in a recommendation released thursday said that while there are vast sums due for overcharges california utilities grid managers and the state agency purchasing power owe generators even more gov gray davis and california officials who attended the day talks held out for billion in refunds but wagner said that amount has not and cannot be substantiated that very large refunds are due is clear wagner wrote likely amounting to hundreds of million of dollars probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum davis said he hoped the federal energy regulatory commission would reject the recommendation californians have by and large gotten a raw deal from ferc during the past year he said in a statement now the day of reckoning for the new ferc has come i would like to believe the commission with two new commissioners will be more sensitive to california consumers and order all the refunds that are due u s sen barbara boxer d calif said the recommendation undermines the consumer protections that ferc is supposed to safeguard by law the differences between what the state wants and what the sellers believe they owe should be decided in a trial type evidentiary hearing that should be held in days wagner said the judge recommended a method for calculating refunds back to october californias estimate is based on figures from may peter navarro a university of california irvine economist who works on energy issues called the recommendation insulting to california the refund order should reach back until at least july he said when energy prices had spiraled to record levels and utilities were accruing billions of dollars in debts setting it arbitrarily from october keeps billions and billions of dollars more in refunds from the state of california he said in calculating costs the judge recommends using the heat rate for the least efficient plant that sold power into the california market on each day that plants costs to produce power will be the basis for setting a benchmark prices that day navarro said thats unfair to california and basing refunds on each individual plants costs would be the best way to calculate what was overcharged by choosing that methodology the judge limits the ability of california to recover whats really owed to it navarro said it reduces the total judgment by as much as percent officials with reliant energy which participated in the negotiations were still reviewing the order but melissa kinch a company spokeswoman said they were hopeful that with the formula all the correct data will come out wagner said california hasnt provided information he requested about the states long term contracts further compounding the calculations he said he has yet to receive information from the california department of water resources the utilities and the independent system operator listing amounts they believe they owe to generators southern california gas fights ferc over routine decision that may cost millions objattph by joe cantlupe copley news service july washington a little noticed decision by federal energy regulators last year is forcing a san diego gas company to spend up to million more for its deliveries with some of that cost expected to be passed on to consumers the decision by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc was already controversial because critics contend it favored a texas natural gas pipeline company now accused of manipulating californias power markets as a result southern california gas a division of sempra energy is preparing to fight the federal energy regulatory commission in court over control over deliveries on a key natural gas pipeline the pipeline in question is an interconnection known as a delivery point at the colorado river near topock ariz despite objections from california officials and socal gas federal regulators last year cut by nearly two thirds socal gass natural gas deliveries from topock according to ferc records instead the federal agency allowed other shippers to make most of the remaining deliveries at the topock connection a key pipeline for access into southern california the decision forced socal gas to tap into more expensive natural gas basins in the southwest and take other more costly and indirect pipeline routes into san diego ferc has severely limited the ability of socal gas to use its reserved pipeline capacity to access cheaper gas said marcel hawiger of the utility reform network the consumer watchdog group based in san francisco socal gas serves million households and small businesses in more than square miles of southern and central california but two thirds of its service area include large industrial and electrical generators such as san diego gas electric co natural gas powers most of the electrical generators in california socal gas estimated a million to million price tag at minimum to comply with the regulators decision its complicated and expensive said lad lorenz director of capacity and operational planning for southern california gas lorenz said socalgas is evaluating the financial fallout and possible impact on consumers socal gas is preparing to challenge the ferc ruling with the u s court of appeals in washington ferc said it was prompted to parcel out deliveries among gas shippers on socal gass topock pipeline connection after receiving complaints about one of the nations largest pipeline companies el paso corp of houston el paso owns two of the five major interstate pipelines that export natural gas to california and it has four major delivery points in the vicinity of topock where it transfers gas to other systems including socal gas nearly half of californias natural gas imports come from the san juan and permian basins in the southwest socalgas and a number of energy companies said they had been complaining for years that el paso was overselling deliveries to gas shippers on its pipelines records show industry experts compared the el paso tactic to an airline overbooking passengers on flights the result was chaotic scheduling and skyrocketing expenses for energy companies that reported losing millions of dollars according to several industry officials and documents filed with ferc trying for solutions ferc initially attempted to let the gas shipping companies sort out the problems themselves that effort failed records show in october ferc determined that el pasos actions were unjust and unreasonable ferc officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said the agency sought an equitable solution to the problem by divvying up the delivery capacity to dozens of gas shippers that had been controlled by socal gas at the topock delivery point the regulators also defended their legal position saying that socal gas did not have the authority to control the flow of natural gas at the topock delivery point despite long term contracts ferc commissioners have not commented on the case socal gas officials insist that fercs solution punished the san diego utility not el paso corp some industry observers contend that ferc botched its oversight of el paso which is facing unrelated allegations of market manipulation ferc allowed el paso to divvy up the space at the california border in such a way so as to benefit marketers and shippers the gas middlemen to the detriment of the utility socal gas which has to ship gas to residential customers in southern california said hawiger of the watchdog group turn california public utilities officials had other concerns saying in documents filed with ferc that the decision made state consumers unwitting victims of el pasos overselling practice moreover state officials wrote el paso has reaped a significant transfer of wealth by its actions officials did not provide details earlier this year california officials filed separate unrelated allegations against el paso charging that the texas company improperly withheld natural gas from the state to drive up prices california officials contend el paso overcharged consumers by billion el paso denies the allegations which are being reviewed by an administrative law judge ultimately ferc will decide whether el paso should be disciplined once again the energy crisis options debated in edison rescue energy legislature is still sharply split over davis plan some want to let the utility fall into bankruptcy miguel bustillo and nancy vogels times staff writer july sacramento a week before its annual summer recess the california legislature remains deeply divided over gov gray davis plan to rescue southern california edison from financial ruin and a growing number of lawmakers are proposing to let the states second largest utility fall into bankruptcy convinced that davis plan is political suicide leading democrats in the assembly and senate on thursday advanced slimmed down alternatives to save edison the fact of the matter is that we just have to act said assembly speaker bob hertzberg d sherman oaks who introduced an alternative plan to rescue edison thursday afternoon and scheduled hearings on it throughout the weekend at issue are competing priorities with important ramifications advocates of the rescue say it is needed to keep the utility solvent and prevent california from descending further into its long running energy crisis critics say it is politically impossible to sell a bailout for the utility and argue that bankruptcy may be a better solution in recent days those critics have appeared to be gaining ground lawmakers conceded thursday that none of the counterproposals to davis bailout plan appears to have sufficient support to clear both houses and none has the blessing of the utility which contends that only the original davis version would make it credit worthy in fact some lawmakers and lobbyists working on the edison deal contend the sudden legislative push is a political exercise designed to deflect criticism and provide cover in case the company goes under california is spending billions to buy about a third of the electricity needed to serve the state because its two largest utilities edison and pacific gas electric are too burdened with debt to do so that dilemma can end only when the utilities are able to resume their role as procurers of power pg e opted to take itself into bankruptcy court in april rather than wait for a political solution to its financial problem but edison reached a sweeping deal with davis later that month that plan has languished in the legislature ever since the agreement calls for california to purchase edisons power transmission grid for billion in turn the company would use the money to retire some of the billion in debt it racked up between may and january when it bought billions of dollars worth of electricity in the wholesale power market but could not recover those costs from customers protected by a state utility rate freeze as a result of the state assistance edison would resume buying electricity for the million people it serves in january if the legislature does not approve the deal davis argues the state will be left in the business of buying that power for far longer but angry consumer groups are threatening to derail any rescue deal with an initiative campaign calling such proposals massive government bailouts and some leery lawmakers are convinced that bankruptcy court would provide a better forum for resolving edisons unwieldy problem tell me why bankruptcy is any worse than any other proposal said state sen mike machado d linden echoing a view he said was shared by many of his colleagues pg e he added seems to be doing quite well in recent weeks said state sen ross johnson r irvine he has received a series of letters from constituents with a penny attached the amount they said they were willing to contribute to a rescue of edison pg e declared bankruptcy months ago johnson said and contrary to prevailing notions the world did not come to an end the tentative rescue deal davis reached with edison allows the utility to back out of the agreement if the legislature does not approve it by aug a deadline lawmakers will almost certainly miss unless they strike a deal before they recess edison officials voice optimism edison officials remain optimistic however that lawmakers will soon fashion an agreement davis threatened this week to haul legislators into a special session on edisons woes later this month if they fail to forge a compromise a tactic that encouraged representatives of the utility were feeling better about the likelihood of having this be resolved in time said edison spokesman brian bennett the edison deal is among many interrelated facets of davis efforts to end the energy crisis and escape with a working electricity market in california as such it is a complicated proposal indeed even some of the basics are hard to discern for one thing the continuing debate in washington over whether california is owed billions in refunds for overcharges by power generators makes it difficult for lawmakers even to be sure how big edisons debt truly is california leaders had hoped a mediator would find common ground between the state and energy companies but those talks broke down earlier this month the refund dispute now moves to the federal energy regulatory commission and possibly to the courts where it could take years to resolve now we have to act not knowing what the outcome of that process will be said assemblyman fred keeley d boulder creek one of the legislators working to craft an edison deal then there is the billion in long term power contracts that davis signed with energy companies this year in hopes of stabilizing supplies for years to come many lawmakers are convinced that those contracts which are to be paid off over the next years by utility consumers will leave less money for the utilities to regain their financial footing that would probably force the state to raise electric rates again in coming months that in turn would make it more politically difficult for lawmakers to approve the edison deal which calls for utility ratepayers to retire the companys billion under collection through a special surcharge on their bills one of the major problems is those long term contracts said assemblyman keith richman r northridge who is leading the gops efforts to cut an edison deal in the assembly these contracts are going to burden the ratepayers for generations and appear to be a major impediment to a solution with edison moreover many lawmakers want to ensure as part of the edison deal that at least the largest business consumers maintain the right to shop around for the cheapest power providers one of the main selling points of californias experiment in electricity deregulation while businesses have been demanding the so called direct access lawmakers and some consumer groups have voiced concern they say droves of businesses will flee the utilities for better deals than the governors long term contracts provide leaving residential customers in the lurch amid all these obstacles a team of senate democrats has been huddling with representatives of the davis administration for the last two days working on a new version of the edison agreement a draft being discussed thursday evening would abandon the controversial plan to purchase the utilitys transmission grid whose value has been questioned also it would not give edison any help in erasing the roughly billion it owes power plant owners leaving the utility to try to get that debt eliminated in the federal fight with the generators instead the new agreement would only help edison shrink the billion in debt it owes to banks and smaller alternative energy producers large power customers would bear the burden of the costs these guys are going to come up with something said senate president pro tempore john burton d san francisco of his senate team if edison doesnt like it theyll have to take a chance and send the davis backed deal up for a vote rival proposal is unveiled in the assembly meanwhile a team of lawmakers thursday unveiled a rival edison proposal that would also attempt to shield homeowners and smaller businesses from high rates to do so it would force industrial consumers to pay the utilitys debts including a portion of the amount owed generators in exchange for allowing big consumers the chance to negotiate their own power deals on the open market the proposal represents an effort to coax generators into accepting less than they are owed by edison because it would allow them to quickly receive prompt payment from large power consumers if they agreed to accept only a fraction of their bills copyright los angeles times http www latimes com the energy crisis developer pulls plug on power plant in chula vista electricity a san diego company cancels plans to build a controversial facility city officials community opponents are thrilled mitchell landsberg times staff writer july a san diego company has canceled plans to build a controversial power plant in chula vista angrily blaming state officials for failing to guarantee that the plant would turn a profit the announcement from ramco inc made public thursday is the latest setback to gov gray davis campaign to get more electricity on line this summer but one state official characterized the decision as evidence that california is now dealing with power companies from a position of strength and can afford to turn down projects if the price isnt right thats the exact position california wants to be in frankly where we can negotiate and if we need to walk away from the table said oscar hidalgo a spokesman for the state department of water resources so well move on to other more willing participants ramco apparently gave up after failing to strike a deal with the department for energy from the proposed plant which would have been near a community recreation center and elementary school in chula vista a city of in southwestern san diego county the plant would have provided megawatts of peaking power which is primarily intended for use during periods of heaviest electricity use sixty two megawatts is enough to serve about homes the developers announcement follows the decision of another san diego company to withdraw plans for a plant in the baldwin hills area of los angeles also in the face of community opposition state officials conceded earlier this week that several other power plant projects appear to be behind schedule chula vista opposed ramco power plant the chula vista city council had opposed the ramco project which would have been built next to another new power plant in a highly urbanized area that is a jumble of industry residences and other uses the first plant began operating around july city officials had complained that the proposed plant would run initially without advanced pollution control devices and together with other new and proposed plants in the area would have a disproportionate impact on a poor predominantly latino population some community activists opposed the plant on similar grounds despite the opposition the energy commission approved the plants license on june the company did not mention community opposition in its letter to the commission and ramco officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment thursday opponents reacted with relief that the plans were being scrapped were thrilled said michael meacham special operations manager for the city of chula vista regardless of the reason for withdrawal were happy about it josie lopez calderon president of san diegos mexican american business and professional assn and a leading opponent of the plant was similarly pleased and said the community opposition had led to the companys withdrawal i think if it was solely for the reasons theyve given all the other peaker plants would be pulling out and i dont see that happening she said so i think our concerns might have had some effect robert laurie the state energy commissioner to whom the companys letter was addressed said that he was not sure he understood the companys rationale but that it seemed clear that ramco was unhappy with the department of water resources since last winter when the states large investor owned utilities became unable to pay for their own energy purchases the agency has been buying most of the states electricity to me it called into question what the policies of dwr were laurie said are they seeking to add power or are they not seeking to add power in his letter ramco president richard mccormack wrote that the company had been optimistic that the department would provide the credit support for the company to supply power to the independent system operator which runs the statewide electrical transmission grid unfortunately he said the department had specifically rejected such support officials at cal iso and the department said they didnt understand mccormacks comments ramco couldnt foresee a reasonable return the letter also said that ramco needed to expect a reasonable return on its investment while dealing with a credit worthy entity in an environment where the sanctity of contract exists there is simply no evidence that we can see even on the horizon that would suggest conditions will improve to the point where ramco could once again consider investing in new power plants in california hidalgo the department spokesman said the agency still intends to sign contracts with energy providers and is willing to continue talks with ramco but can now afford to be pickier than it was earlier this year when it was criticized for signing more than billion in long term contracts at rates that some considered exorbitant gary ackerman a spokesman for the western power trading forum an organization of power traders and generators said he didnt understand why ramcos failure to sign a contract with the department would doom the project after all he said the agency is not the only buyer of electricity you could take market risk and build that plant he said abandoning it doesnt make any sense he said he knew of no other energy generator contemplating a similar pullout rob schlichting a spokesman for the energy commission noted that ramco could still build the plant under the terms of its license the plant would have to be completed by sept copyright los angeles times http www latimes com the energy crisis some state energy consultants own generators stock ethics they negotiate deals and buy electricity from power firms gop officials claim credit for forcing the disclosure of potential conflict eric bailey times staff writer july sacramento more than half a dozen consultants hired by the state to purchase electricity and to negotiate long term power deals own stock in generating companies such as calpine and enron that have profited handsomely during californias energy crisis the potential conflict of interest emerged thursday with the release of financial disclosure statements by consultants who have been hired by the state since the start of the power crunch among those disclosing stock ownership were two key negotiators of long term energy contracts and two workers hired to purchase electricity from generators including some of the firms in which they hold an interest several other consultants who played key roles in the states energy efforts decided not to file financial disclosure statements citing legal exemptions under state law among those who did not file the financial disclosure statements were a pair of executives at two wall street firms that stand to make million if the state buys californias power grid of about consultants hired by the state in the past six months filed the disclosures the disclosures follow a firestorm in sacramento last month over the hiring by gov gray davis of two media consultants also employed by southern california edison the troubled utility that is negotiating with the state over a bailout package steve maviglio a davis spokesman said the governors legal staff was reviewing the financial disclosure forms for any potential conflicts of interest if theres anything inappropriate maviglio said then well deal with it republicans however said the hired workers had revealed overt conflicts that clearly violated state law secretary of state bill jones a republican running for governor against davis next year said the revelations call into question the work performed by the consultants on high priced energy contracts that are going to mortgage our childrens future for decades to come if you show a conflict the potential is there for collusion jones said im not accusing anyone but thats why you have disclosure rob stutzman a state gop spokesman said he was particularly troubled because the consultants had delayed filing the disclosure forms for months under state law the forms are supposed to be submitted within days after the consultants go to work for the state most of the energy consultants who could not be reached for comment reported owning relatively small amounts of stock in energy firms generally less than but one of the new workers william mead disclosed that he owned between and million in calpine a san jose based energy firm mead did not report when the stock had been

before she came to work for the state as an energy trader constantine louie an energy scheduler reported owning between and in calpine stock republicans took credit for forcing the davis administration to file the reports a charge the governors office brushed aside jones the secretary of state held a news conference tuesday to complain about the failure of nearly all the states energy consultants to file any sort of financial disclosure forms the statements were only made available late in the afternoon thursday months after many consultants went to work for the state maviglio the governors spokesman said the delays were explained in part by negotiations that began in march with the fair political practices commission the states ethics watchdog to determine if the consultants were required to file the forms he also suggested that jones accusations were fueled more by campaign politics than any devotion to constitutional duty one needs to question why the secretary of state is using taxpayer money to investigate something beyond his jurisdiction maviglio said thats why we have an fppc to look at these kinds of things copyright los angeles times http www latimes com the

refunds of alleged overcharges senate democrats set the high target despite a federal mediators ruling against davis earlier this week the mediator said california would be entitled to only about billion in generator overcharges not the billion that davis has fought for senate officers said the cost of the mail campaign will be paid from the budgets of senators at taxpayer expense as part of the legislatures constituent service mail program but republicans attacked the mailer as political propaganda that may violate state law and senate policy barring issuance of partisan documents at public expense sketchy details of the quietly developed project surfaced on the senate floor thursday staffers who worked on it said it was virtually impossible to calculate the programs cost but they indicated that if all democrats agreed to send up to mailers each to constituents the postage alone would cost if each mass mailing exceeded pieces a higher postage rate would apply raising the cost officials said in the mailer constituents are asked to return an attached card to their state senator urging full refunds of the outrageous prices charged by the greedy out of state power generators cynthia lavagetto manager of the senate mail program said each member will decide what do do with the returned cards including simply filing them or sending them on to ferc lavagetto said a prototype mailer was prepared with the help of the select committee on citizen participation a panel that has no chairman or members since it has not been activated this year but it does maintain an office and has three staffers on the senate payroll burton dismissed the republican charges of partisanship as baseless we do this all the time on a variety of issues he said were saying stop stealing californias money but sen ross johnson of irvine the senates senior republican denounced the mailing as clearly partisan he said it appeared to reflect a developing election strategy of davis and democrats to blame the ferc and out of state generators for californias energy mess i seriously question the appropriateness of using taxpayer money to get people to lobby for the refunds johnson said johnson and sen ray haynes r riverside suggested that democrats turn their criticism to municipal utilities including the los angeles department of water and power some utilities charged the state even higher prices last winter than did private generators why are they not attacking the dwp johnson asked he noted that s david freeman was running the dwp at the time some of its highest prices were charged to the state which is buying power for californias financially crippled utilities later davis hired freeman as his top energy price negotiator doesnt david freeman more properly belong in

officials told the u s environmental protection agency yesterday california regulators and environmentalists on the other hand said the federal policy that requires the best available pollution

environmental representatives lined up yesterday at one of four hearings held by the u s environmental protection agency across the country to argue over the importance of requiring tough reviews and

pollution broome said the epa has been requiring a wider plant review that might include installing thousands of dollars of new pollution control technology instead said nelson meeks a clorox

pollution control weakening protections would have a devastating impact on air quality and public health in california he said allowing a new power plant to operate without the controls even running

totaling million as a reward for slashing electricity use in june the utility said yesterday the program that cuts percent off ratepayers bills if they reduce usage by percent was a high profile initiative by gov gray davis to promote conservation and decrease dependence on out of state generators so far pg e has given credits to ratepayers or percent of those who have received their bills said utility spokeswoman staci homrig thousands of additional ratepayers stand to get rebates because the utility has processed only a third of its billing cycle the news was giddily received by the davis administration which has made conservation a cornerstone its plan to dig out of californias energy mess administration officials had projected that to percent of customers would conserve enough to get a rebate if only percent of customers qualified davis estimated that the savings to the state which has been buying power on behalf of financially troubled utilities would be between million and billion the less power used means the less power the state has to purchase for the utilities on the expensive spot market heroic effort wow this is fantastic said davis spokesman roger salazar what this says is that californians are taking their conservation seriously the governor could not be prouder of their heroic effort so far about half the rebate amount million went to residential customers with million going to agricultural industrial and commercial customers the utility will not have the amount of the average rebate until later this month when it completes the billing cycle to qualify customers have to reduce their electricity use by percent for any of the four monthly billing periods that end in july august september and october over a comparable period in customers can get the rebate for more than one month the rebate is labeled california rebate and appears on monthly bills right above the line marked total amount due whether it be out of fear of dodging hours of rolling blackouts predicted for the state this summer or the desire to save cash the number of rebates is another signal that californians are conserving energy even if there is some disagreement on how much last month davis announced that power usage was down percent in may after being adjusted for growth and weather in terms of raw unadjusted data californias overall electricity consumption in may was down only about percent from the previous year sweet reward that was little matter to those who received a rebate for them it was a sweet reward for months of bumbling through darkened rooms watching less tv and enduring skyrocketing power bills those who didnt get the rebate were disappointed especially if they have endured small personal sacrifices in the hope of saving power and cash for example pierre chomat a retired engineering firm manager in pacific grove takes only two baths a week as part of his conservation plan despite his bathing cutback and replacing incandescent bulbs with fluorescent ones and turning off pilot lights chomats utility usage went up last month he blamed his three houseguests for robbing him of the chance at a rebate they were taking baths and doing

representatives sought and would not come in cash that very large refunds are due is clear wagner wrote in a page opinion to members of the commission expanding on remarks he made publicly monday while the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the state of california they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billion dollars however he went on the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated wagners opinion appeared to paint the california delegates to the days of talks as unreasonable unwilling to negotiate and perhaps more motivated to score political points than resolve the states yearlong dispute over energy prices there is an old saying down south that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink wagner wrote the problem was that there were those who simply did not want to negotiate but rather stood firm on their litigation position with no movement wagner wrote that californias negotiators had summarily rejected his settlement proposal but did not say what that was collectively the states power providers made a counteroffer of slightly more than million it was not clear if they ever offered to come up michael kahn president of the states independent system operator board and davis chief negotiator during the sessions said the state refused to budge because generators had demanded exemptions from various inquiries he said the california delegation did not summarily reject the judges proposal to bring the parties to the table saying wagner never came up with a specific plan or dollar figure some energy analysts have argued that the billion figure produced by the iso was flawed from the start the iso made inaccurate assumptions about gas prices and the rate at which some plants burn it to generate electricity critics said and it didnt look at whether the states two main utilities also charged prices above the competitive benchmark the iso also looked at a period stretching back to may even though the date from which refunds would be considered in the negotiations began in october wagner said california and its utilities debts to the energy providers estimated at billion by some participants is larger than any refund the power companies owe as a result he said any refunds awarded to the state should come in the form of either forgiveness of debt or lower prices on long term power contracts the state has signed wagner suggested the federal commissioners hold days of evidentiary hearings rather than relying on economic analysis to figure out

after they couldnt reach an agreement with the state department of water resources on the amount of energy to be generated at the proposed plant the natural gas fired generator would have produced up

expire until the end of september sacramento ap state legislators are taking their campaign against the federal energy regulatory commission public the democratic led senate wants to send mailers to californians asking them to join gov gray davis in demanding that ferc commissioners order the refunds of alleged overcharges by power companies state officials claim california is owed billion but a federal mediator said this week that hundreds of millions of dollars should likely be refunded people who receive the mailers would be asked to return an attached card to their state senator urging full refunds senators then would decide whether to file the cards or send them to ferc talk about the mailers surfaced on the senate floor thursday senate officers said the cost of the mailer campaign would come at taxpayers expense the cost hasnt been determined but if democrats agreed to send up to mailers the postage would cost more than republicans said they were opposed to the idea claiming it violated state law and senate policy prohibiting the issuance of partisan documents that are paid by taxpayers i seriously question the appropriateness of using taxpayer money to get people to lobby

electricity and natural gas prices and a big drop in gasoline costs gave the country the best performance on wholesale inflation in more than two years the labor department reported that the drop in its produce price index which measures price pressures before they reach the consumer was the first decline since last august and the biggest drop since a percent fall in february analysts had been expecting that inflation would moderate after steep increases earlier this year driven by a big jump in energy prices they also said the sharp slowdown in economic activity was helping to ease inflationary pressures as wage demands soften with the rising jobless rate meanwhile a second report friday showed that retail sales rose percent in june pushed up by a strong percent surge in sales of new cars while the overall number was slightly weaker than analysts had been expecting the government revised its estimate for may sales sharply higher to percent rather than the original estimate of a much smaller percent gain beginning last summer u s economic growth has slowed dramatically with many analysts believing that growth in the just completed april june quarter will come in at a weak annual rate of percent even worse than the percent growth recorded in the first three months of the year still economists believe consumers will keep the economy out of a full blown recession with their spending expected to increase in coming months reflecting the boost provided by lower interest rates and the big tax cut passed by congress the federal reserve has cut interest rates six times so far this year its most aggressive credit easing in the next two decades in an effort to make sure that the u s economy does not tip into recession analysts said the good news on inflation will give the fed room to cut interest rates further if needed to provide fuel for an economic rebound the feds next meeting is aug ken mayland chief economist at clearview economics in cleveland said that both the benign report on wholesale prices and the moderate gain in retail sales pointed to an economy that would rebound in the second half of this year there is reason to be optimistic about the economys prospects we are going to be transitioning to considerably better growth in the third quarter said mayland whose own forecast puts overall economic growth at a percent rate in the third quarter three times the percent growth figure he expects for the second quarter president bush who next week will attend his first economic summit of the worlds seven richest countries in genoa italy is counting on the feds rate cuts and the stimulative effect of his trillion tax cut to lift the economy to a stronger growth rate later this year the percent drop in wholesale prices in june left inflation at this level rising at an annual rate of percent through the first six months of this year far better than last years percent the news was just as good excluding volatile energy and food prices the so called core rate of inflation edged up just percent in june even better than the small percent increases in april and may so far this year the core rate of inflation at the wholesale level is rising at an annual rate of just percent for june the big drop in overall prices was led by a percent plunge in energy costs the biggest one month decline since a percent drop in april the good news on energy reflected record drops of percent in residential energy costs and percent in natural gas prices gasoline prices fell by percent the biggest decline since a percent fall last august economists had been predicting that energy prices would retreat following a sharp run up last winter that was caused by a shortage of supplies still residents of california face difficult problems and potential power shortages this summer because of the shortage of electrical generating capacity motorists this summer have been getting a break at the gas pump after world crude oil prices eased and refiners rushed to fill shortages that developed during the spring food prices in june edged up percent after having fallen by percent in may the increase reflected gains of percent for beef and percent for dairy products outside of food and energy prices remained well contained prescription drug prices fell by percent their biggest drop since january tobacco prices which had risen a sharp

thursday july by dana hull in another sign that energy conservation is paying off hundreds of thousands of consumers are opening power bills this month to find that they have earned a percent rebate from the state for slashing summer electricity use whats more preliminary figures compiled by utility companies indicate that many more households and businesses are qualifying for the automatic cash credit than gov gray davis and his energy team anticipated pacific gas electric has processed about million bills this month and customers or percent have qualified for the rebate said spokeswoman staci homrig early expectations were that only percent to percent would qualify it warms the cockles of ones heart to hear these numbers s david freeman the governors chief energy adviser said thursday nobody dreamed we would have gotten this kind of response the people of california are smart money talks homrig said thrifty consumers including residential commercial industrial and agricultural customers earned million in credits of that million went to residential users and nearly million to the others consumer interest in conservation has been high particularly since a progressive electricity rate increase kicked in june the full extent of participation in the rebate program will be known as the month progresses utilities process bills daily rather than at once the numbers elsewhere southern california edison has yet to calculate its figures but in san diego where consumers have to cut back only percent to get the percent rebate the numbers are even higher percent have earned rebates san diego customers were the first in the state to suffer skyrocketing costs for electricity and began conserving last summer so their conservation threshold was lowered for the program the rebates which compare this summers use to last summers are available to about million homes and businesses that get electricity from pg e southern california edison and san diego gas electric originally the rebate was to come at the end of the summer but now appears on each monthly summer bill unplugging a second refrigerator or turning off an air conditioner can result in large energy savings and many consumers have swarmed web sites and phone lines for other ways to cut usage still utility executives and state officials alike are astonished at the high early figures this is excellent news and we applaud our customers for making the effort said jennifer andrews of sempra energy the parent company of san diego gas electric in our first five cycles of billing we have applied approximately million in rebates nearly million went to residential customers to other accounts brett kennedy of morgan hill first became a conservation fanatic over the winter when the

energy star refrigerator the moves have paid off his electricity use is down percent from this time last year i got a rebate on my bill kennedy said pretty tough way to earn the early rebate numbers are in line with recent statewide conservation figures californians used percent less electricity this june than last i think its phenomenal said susanne garfield of the california energy commission the rebate is icing on the cake critics have blasted the program for rewarding those who have been wasteful in the past we feel were being burned yet again by the governor said kathy erpenbeck of menlo park we would have to unplug our fridge our computer the water heater the tv and the one or two lights we use each day to approach a percent decrease thanks to our past low volume of use but state officials say those consumers will see lower power bills because low energy users largely escape the rate increase savings on demand the figures drive home the fact that california residents whether motivated by a fear of high bills or a desire to fight back against power companies are making a huge dent in the states electricity demand weve shrunk the spot market freeman said people are

thursday july by john woolfolk and steve johnson mercury news the state has failed to prove california was overcharged anywhere near billion for electricity a federal judge said thursday in a sharply critical recommendation on calculating potential refunds after two weeks of unsuccessful settlement talks the judge overseeing them agreed california is due very large refunds but repeated his earlier estimates that the amount is closer to billion the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated judge curtis wagner wrote in a page recommendation urging a hearing within days on the refund it is now up to the five member federal energy regulatory commission to hold hearings and order refunds wagner sharply criticized state officials for refusing to budge on the billion peter navarro an economist at the university of california irvine said the judge sided with the generators on every single key issue the ferc judge adopted a set of rules that effectively slashed the size of californias possible refunds by up to percent navarro said the recommendation left neither side cheering state leaders were irked the judge didnt back their number they will press commissioners to order the full refund immediately instead of the hearing it is clear that judge wagners recommendation undermines the consumer protections that ferc is supposed to safeguard by law u s sen barbara boxer d calif said gov gray davis said he hopes president bushs two new appointees on the commission will be more sensitive to california consumers and order all the refunds that are due energy suppliers who offered the state million to settle the matter and industry officials greeted the recommendation with caution gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum a trade group said he was encouraged the judge didnt back the states figure but he added there is no reason for us to be confident or comfortable well have to see how this hearing unfolds he said a spokesman for mirant corp one of the five major california power generators was circumspect this is just another step in this process pat dorinson said wagner offered no specific refund figure of his own repeating instead estimates he made before the talks began that very large refunds are due is clear wagner said while the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the state of california they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billion dollars that amount is far more than the million in potential refunds federal regulators had identified earlier this year but its still less than what the state owes energy suppliers for past sales meaning any refund would probably be in the form of canceled debt the states billion figure was calculated by analysts who oversee the power grid and has been hotly challenged by suppliers a key dispute is the period subject to refund the state figure is based upon sales from may to may but wagner said the number should be calculated from last october when the federal commission notified sellers they could face refunds michael kahn the states chief negotiator said the figure could be up to billion and said it was disappointing the judge wouldnt consider earlier refunds the state he said would continue pressing for them the judge recommended that the commission calculate refunds using its latest

generators saying the figure would probably amount to more than billion but wagner in a report to the commission indicated that the state might not get even that generators serving california are owed

case in the central valley including the case against ford detailed in the articles below apparently the verdict was later overturned due to juror misconduct and a tv show tainted the million verdict he was also involved in a highly publicized case in which the catholic diocese of stockton was ordered to pay million as the result of molestations by a priest hes well known in trial lawyer circles

article image printer friendly version modesto calif now high is up thats the question that thousands of giddy personal injury lawyers are asking themselves in the wake of two astronomical punitive damage awards handed out by california juries within three days of each other in july in one of the judgments modesto jurors ordered ford motor co to pay million in punitive damages to a young man whose mother father and brother were killed when he tipped over his bronco on fathers day at the time of the accident juan ramon romo then had been driving for a lengthy period of time so long in fact that everyone else in the bronco his mother and father a brother and two sisters had fallen asleep going slightly over the speed limit on an interstate highway romo attempted illegally to pass another vehicle on the right when the other driver decided to move back into the right lane romo swerved left and rolled over his mother father and brother were killed he and his two sisters survived the million judgment in the romo case was the second largest ever entered against a u s car manufacturer yet it received little media attention outside the immediate modesto area hardly surprising perhaps since only three days before a las angeles jury had set the punitive damage bar impossibly high by ordering general motors to pay a staggering punitive damage award of billion by way of a yardstick that amount surpasses the combined gross national product of afghanistan and albania almost obscured by the astonishing generosity of the jurors in los angeles and modesto was a salient point that still sends shivers through corporate defense lawyers around the country by any objective criteria neither ford nor general motors appeared to bear any responsibility for the accidents in the los angeles case patricia anderson her four children and a family friend were stopped at a red light in her chevy malibu on christmas eve a drunken driver traveling at mph slammed his car into the malibus rear end the collision ruptured the malibus gas tank and ignited the spilled fuel mrs andersons four children suffered severe burns when police tested the drunken driver he registered a blood alcohol content of twice the legal limit for drivers in california similarly in the modesto case driver error and misjudgment on the part of romo clearly appeared to be the cause of the accident but romos lawyer lawrence drivon immediately blamed the deaths on the bronco which he said was susceptible to rollover and had a defectively designed roof yet the bronco exceeded all federal safety standards for roof strength in by more than percent and in fact exceeds the standard by more than percent romos bronco also exceeded all federal rollover standards for model and federal accident data show the ford broncos rollover rate was no higher than that of other suvs its open to question whether the bronco had been properly maintained prior to the accident the vehicle had been on the road for years had numerous changes in ownership and had nearly miles on the odometer in addition drivon engaged in conduct that borders on jury tampering mailing to each juror a copy of his book the civil war on consumer rights whose main thesis is that large american corporations like ford are attempting to close the courthouse doors to average americans by pressing for judicial reforms in the book drivon devotes an entire chapter to fords alleged misdeeds in part because of drivons behavior a california judge granted fords motion to set aside the punitive damage part of the verdict and ordered a new trial among other things he cited improper discussions among the jurors that prejudiced deliberations but ford could be entering double jeopardy with a new trial drivon has indicated he will seek to raise the initial punitive award threefold to more than billion with a sympathetic jury that could happen damage award of a few hundred million here and a few hundred million there are still unusual

with the years fifth largest verdict the modesto jury awarded million to three children whose parents and brother died when their ford bronco rolled over in a highway accident the verdict included million in punitive damages the second largest punitive award ever against an automaker the defense argued that the drivers of the two vehicles not the company were responsible for the tragedy but a person jury found the automaker liable for the deaths concluding that ford chose to save money by opting for a less sturdy roof design the jury divided the remaining liability between the two drivers a company spokesman told the modesto bee that as tragic as the accident was it wasnt our fault and it wasnt the vehicles fault lawyers for neither the plaintiff nor the defendant could be reached for comment this story is based on local newspaper and wire stories from the time of the verdict bronco rolls over on june year old juan romo was driving five other family members home to northern california when he attempted to pass a van on the right at approximately mph the vans driver didnt see romo and changed lanes at the same time forcing romo to swerve hard to the right to avoid him romo then overcorrected with a hard turn to the left lost control and while traveling about mph the vehicle rolled over killing romos mother salustia his father ramon and his brother ramiro romos parents and brother were all wearing their seatbelts and died because the broncos roof smashed straight down onto the dashboard and crushed their heads according to plaintiffs attorneys juan and his two sisters evangelina and maria suffered only minor injuries plaintiffs attorney joseph carcione jr told the modesto bee that the sisters survived because they werent wearing their seatbelts and were thrown from the bronco romo survived because he ducked below the dashboard said carcione name partner in a lawyer firm in redwood city calif romo and his sisters sued ford alleging that the automaker knew the broncos roof which was two thirds plastic would not hold up in a rollover carcione and his co counsel laurence drivon argued that ford knew the roof was unsafe but decided to save the relatively small cost of reinforcing it with steel a defect the company corrected in post model years according to a press release carcione described the roof as a camper top to manufacture the vehicle ford basically chopped off the back portion of a pickup truck and stuck on the plastic camper top put a bench seat in the back and removed a warning that had been posted on the camper top that said do not ride under this camper top carcione said in the release the plaintiffs attorneys also contended that the bronco was unsafe because it was prone to rollover the vehicles rollover rate is three to five times higher than any other passenger car and its rollover death rate is almost three times greater than the model broncos they say in a press release although carcione and drivon lacked explicit documentation to illustrate the broncos structural weaknesses they filled that gap with a prize witness former ford executive vice president tom feeney who testified that company officials were aware that the roof was virtually certain to fail in a rollover feeney gave additional testimony that in the years he had worked for the company the bronco was the worst vehicle ford ever put out in terms of crashworthiness ford countered that the bronco was perfectly sound and met all federal safety standards noting that feeney had never worked in truck product development defense attorneys also argued that romo was at fault and that his right hand passing maneuver was illegal they contended that the vans driver was also partly to blame on july the jury awarded the romo family million in compensatory damages and million in punitives at the close of the three month trial the plaintiffs attorneys urged jurors to award punitives totaling billion they noted after the trial that the million award amounts to only days worth of fords net profits drivon partner in a four lawyer firm in stockton calif also called the bronco the most dangerous vehicle ford ever made the american public is waking up to the carnage thats being visited upon the public by some american industries such as tobacco and automobiles he told the associated press new trial pending following the verdict defense attorneys asked for a mistrial claiming that romos counsel made inflammatory public statements supporting the billion gm verdict which came down while jurors in his own case were still in deliberations the motion was denied ford appealed and on sept the trial judge ordered a new trial on punitives finding that the case was tainted by juror misconduct one juror told others of a minutes ii segment about ford mustangs and fuel tank fires and told them it was evidence of fords malice regarding the bronco wrote superior court judge roger beauchesne another juror told the jury of a morbid nightmare she had in which her child and other jurors children were killed in a bronco rollover while being taunted by ford attorneys the judge wrote beauchesne said the two jurors comments may have influenced the deliberations and noted that the jury vote on punitive damages was the exact majority needed the wall street journal reported that carcione said hes delighted to try the case again reversing the million award was no victory for ford the next jury will award even higher damages said carcione in a press release four of the jurors in the last trial wanted to assess punitive damages at a billion dollars or more the million amount was reached as a compromise drivon echoed carciones thoughts sooner of later ford will have to accept what american jurors will continue to say that this bronco is the result of malicious actions by ford who willfully put profits ahead of people he said in a press release beauchesne upheld the jurys unanimous finding that the broncos defective roof caused the deaths of romos family members while ford expressed its gratitude at the new punitives trial it may appeal the compensatory damage award as well as the jurys finding of liability according to wire reports drivon advised ford not to celebrate prematurely the best they get out of this is that theyre exposed to the verdict of a second jury he told the associated press lawyers

caminus and altra energy partner to create full service trading scientechs issuealert todays issuealert sponsors image scientech is currently interviewing utilities on cis crm and customer care in the united states and canada to determine the leading software providers drivers of utility technology decisions analysis of license sales versus asp sales new market opportunities growing shrinking software markets download a sample prospectus for an introduction to this new survey at http secure scientech com specialpages multi client asp and contact jon brock at for more details image image october caminus and altra energy partner to create full service trading software provider by will mcnamara director electric industry analysis image news item from reuters software company caminus corp nasdaq camz announced it would buy the software operations of privately held altra energy corp caminus said it would swap shares of its stock and pay million cash for altras software business that values the deal at about million based on caminus closing price of on oct analysis the announcement that caminus and altra energy are joining forces represents major news for the energy industry particularly impacting those companies that are involved in the trading sector on their own both companies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche now that caminus is acquiring altras software suite which is primarily focused on the natural gas trading sector the synergy between the two companies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved in energy trading essentially altra has two core businesses an energy trading exchange and a software business caminus has entered into an agreement process to purchase only the software side of altra altra has a highly regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily focused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operations together the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greater participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges lets first establish the business models of these two companies so that we can fully appreciate the synergies that the new partnership will create up to the point of this partnership caminus and altra were not considered direct line competitors as caminus business model focused on risk management while altra focused on the actual energy transactions however there were components of the companies businesses that certainly overlapped caminus corp has created a software suite that helps utilities and gas producers trade energy commodities in exchanges such as enrononline tradespark houstonstreet etc altras software which is used in the same energy trading portals focuses on natural gas transactions headquartered in new york caminus which went public a year ago is a provider of software solutions and consulting services that help a wide range of participants in the energy market to manage their risk factors associated with energy trading toward that end the company offers two software packages zai net software solutions which enables energy organizations to effectively trade and manage energy transactions zai net has been designed to address a wide range of energy commodities traded instruments and associated risks and was designed to interface with both proprietary and third party systems nucleus software systems which were designed specifically to meet the trading risk management scheduling and accounting needs of utilities generating companies power pools gas and oil producers processors pipelines and other energy market participants in other words the caminus nucleus system provides a tool for energy traders to organize track and manage their various energy transactions from generation to end user delivery one of the advantages to the nucleus software is that users can evaluate assets and market positions in real time and consequently determine acceptable risk levels recently caminus added the storefront product which is a web based trading application that helps customers to increase trading volume and reduce transaction costs by publishing bids and offers on the internet also just this week at the power mart conference in houston caminus unveiled a new software product known as frontoffice which gives traders of energy physicals and traded instruments the ability to see how a potential deal will affect a portfolio before committing to the transaction according to company reports approximately percent of caminus revenue comes from software license sales in addition caminus also has a consulting service that focuses on risk management services for energy clients one reason that caminus has gotten a good share of industry attention lately is its efforts along with other software companies to establish a common standard for moving transaction data from energy trading platforms to transaction risk management systems a few months ago caminus established the energy trading standards group with houstonstreet and has since generated interest in some companies to participate and help create universal standards for energy trading one of the key objectives of the standards group is to help determine which technology should be used as the standard protocol for energy trading platforms the technology committee is reportedly working on a beta version of xml standard for physical power transactions in september caminus formed a strategic partnership with lodestar corp which primarily provides billing software and load forecasting solutions under the partnership caminus and lodestar will work to integrate and jointly market their respective wholesale and retail energy billing transaction trading and risk management systems to create what they are calling a straight through processing stp environment for vertically integrated energy companies by comparison altra energy is a private company located in houston that provides software systems primarily focused on managing the transactions and physical movement of the gas and pipeline segment of the industry altra reportedly has the largest base of systems in the gas segment of the market some of the specific features of the altra software include scheduling of direct access load generation dispatch regional transmission organization rto connectivity integrated oasis reservations and north american electric reliability council nerc checkout and billing altra boasts a customer list of about clients mostly in the gas sector but also including power and multi fuel companies altras software product suite includes transaction management tools known as altra gas altra power altra pipeline and altra web which all facilitate the exchange of a particular commodity according to caminus the value of acquiring altras software suite is to create an offering of integrated applications that can be applied to both gas and power traders further the exchange of customers should benefit both companies caminus will have the opportunity to sell its risk management services to altras customer base and in turn gain the opportunity to sell altras new generation of systems to caminus customers the european market is arguably the top focus of caminus corp in fact caminus believes that the global market for energy trading is presently exploding according to caminus ceo david stoner the global market for wholesale energy trading which consists of the european market is six to eight times the size of retail markets consequently a typical therm gets traded a number of times in europe before it actually gets sold to an end user interestingly about to percent of the companies to which caminus has provided risk management consulting services are u s companies attempting to expand in the european wholesale trading market caminus consultants helped write the new electricity trading arrangements neta for the british government due to be implemented by the end of or early although smaller than the u s market britain has been experiencing privatization and various levels of deregulation since providing valuable experience and depth besides the u k caminus has been active throughout europe in italy spain holland belgium germany and the nordic countries through nordpool earnings for caminus have been fairly strong up until recently when fallout from the events of sept began to impact the companys business for q caminus reported that its total revenues increased percent to million compared to million for q specifically revenues from the companys software license fees increased percent to million during the same quarter however for q caminus lost or cents a share on revenue of million due primarily to the fact some license sales that were expected to close did not specifically caminus says that much of the revenue from its license sales is booked during the last month of each quarter given the impact that the events of sept had on many companies a large part of this anticipated revenue was not booked as scheduled moving forward caminus says that the addition of altras software should result in an increase of its revenue guidance by about percent caminus also expects the partnership with altra to increase its q earnings to cents a share compared with a previous estimate of cents a share although analysts are still projecting cents a share for the fourth quarter deregulation has opened up many new opportunities for generation companies to trade and market power in new regions however with these opportunities come considerable risks hence creating this balance between risk and opportunity in the energy trading space is the market niche in which caminus and altra operate however the software market in the energy trading space is becoming increasingly competitive every month new competitors in this space emerge so it is difficult to offer a comprehensive list however some competitors that also seek market share in the niche now occupied by caminus altra are allegro development kwi and solarc to name just a few moreover competition in wholesale trading should continue to gain momentum regardless of the status of deregulation in a particular state the wholesale market is without question far more attractive to traders than the retail market and as i mentioned power is often traded many times on the wholesale market before it reaches the end user thus consolidation within the energy trading software space should continue and i would expect caminus to proceed with further acquisitions once it integrates the altra software into its service offerings clarification statement to issuealert on dynegy in its q earnings statement dynegy reported that net income of its transmission and distribution company illinois power was million versus million in q in the column we incorrectly stated that illinois power had taken a loss of million the loss of

last week catch up on the latest deregulation competition and restructuring developments in the energy industry with scientechs issueswatch image image october enrons departure from core business takes a toll on performance by will mcnamara director electric industry analysis image news item from reuters enron corp nyse ene stock sustained further heavy losses on october as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years the energy giants stock was off or percent at per share at mid day trade on oct making a cumulative loss of percent for a week in which it reported a third quarter loss of million as of early morning trading on oct enron shares were priced at a reflection of new developments including a new securities and exchange inquiry that have caused uncertainty about the company among investors analysis enrons first financial report since the departure of former ceo jeffrey skilling in august has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory while skilling cited personal reasons for his departure many analysts suspected that a significant drop in enrons share price and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role at the time of skillings departure enrons stock had tumbled to a week low however based on the new q report it now appears that enrons downward turn may be continuing despite the return of kenneth lay to the companys top spot in essence enrons financial problems have been caused by businesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its core focus on wholesale power sales it appears that enron is learning a costly lesson namely that investors are not responding favorably to the companys innovation especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromised the road ahead may remain uncertain for enron as a good number of unresolved issues and a new securities and exchange commission sec inquiry into financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company lets first establish the financial losses that enron has reported in the third quarter as noted as a whole the company reported million in losses after taking billion in charges associated with several of its non core businesses when we break down the losses it becomes clear that enron is struggling with its operations in three businesses water broadband and the retail power market specifically enron reported million in charges from azurix its water and wastewater business million in charges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations including severance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts and million in what the company is calling investment losses evidently about half of the million figure is related to enrons investment in newpower company the retail electricity and natural gas provider that enron launched about two years ago with partners america online and ibm enron owns percent of newpower in addition enrons debt to total capitalization ratio reportedly will increase to about percent although lay says that pending asset sales may reduce that amount to percent by the end of however it is important to note that enrons q recurring net income before the write offs did increase percent to million or cents a diluted share and revenue in the quarter rose to billion from billion in q the losses associated with newpower are particularly interesting as one of the leading investors in the company enron drove newpowers aggressive business focus on retail residential power sales despite ongoing concerns about the development of retail competition across the united states newpower went public last year at an opening price of and in the early days of its initial public offering was trading above that price however the companys stock has experienced a devastating drop in value and is currently priced at newpower is not scheduled to release its own q financial statement until early november but it is expected that the company will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future specifically newpower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a q loss of million to million or to a share third quarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the million to million that the company had forecast in august in analyzing newpowers q financial losses see issuealert from at www scientech com rci i argued that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the united states on the positive side newpower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from aes corp and dte energy these purchases prompted an impressive growth spurt for newpower and the company reportedly now has a customer base in markets in states however the bad news for newpower is that its losses continue to widen apparently resulting from a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the company operates this dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better and the companys stock has continued to drop as a result in an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes newpower recently revised an existing master netting agreement with enron corp and several of its subsidiaries the revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cash collateral that newpower is required to post to the enron subsidiaries through jan with the lowered financial obligations that it must make to enron newpower believes that it will have sufficient financial resources to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset based financing however from enrons perspective the losses associated with newpower and by the same token the losses in water and broadband have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price the message is clear the businesses that enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole further what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on enrons part has not translated into measurable profits and consequently wall street has reacted by sending enrons stock to a level that is about half of where it was a year ago the individual sectors that enron has pursued are all unique but they share the common denominator of taking enron away from what was a successful core business further they are similar in that enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which it arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth the problem with enrons bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of fiber optic lines which has prevented the demand for the divisions services from materializing as anticipated the problem with azurix which has been losing money since its formation in is that privatization of the water sector has not materialized as quickly as enron and other companies anticipated in addition to these problem areas enron also faces challenges related to its investments in india where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government and california from which enron has yet to receive full payment for previous power sales in addition to the losses outlined in the q report there are new issues that are brewing at the start of this week first the sec has requested that enron provide information regarding certain related party transactions not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry however it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns related to the dealings of enrons chief financial officer andrew fastow who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from enron ken lay has said that enron will cooperate fully with the secs request in a separate development several mutual funds including aim constellation that once held large positions in enron have either liquidated or reduced their holdings in the company which has further weakened enrons stock value portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about enrons ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader the present challenge for enron is to convince investors that the company remains on solid ground despite the losses thus lay has been quick to reiterate that earnings from the companys energy and gas pipeline business are still strong further lay says that the charges reported in the third quarter should be seen as a way to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses nevertheless the fact remains that enron has invested huge amounts of money toward its diversification effort and in addition to water and broadband the company has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well thus several questions remain at this juncture are the losses reported in the third quarter only a temporary setback for enron that will clear the way for the company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trading or will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and moving forward will enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably only time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at enron which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change an archive
