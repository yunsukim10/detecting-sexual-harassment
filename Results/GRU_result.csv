testing preschedule workspace i pulled it up but the fields need some explaining give me a call at your conveneince to walk me thru c testing preschedule workspace yes but vish made the changes in table edit will testing preschedule workspace so this table edit that brett is asking me to test is really from you testing preschedule workspace cara we have recently added to table edit the ability to create aliases for counterparties also you should be able to add extended information about each counterparty the tab in table edit is counterparty extensions and when you select new ole object picture device independent bitmap try creating a few aliases and see if they work because the process takes so long you might limit it to a small number of paths in the meantime we will be looking into why the process is slow regards will endofsignature testing preschedule workspace when i sent this email the workspace error log popped up the total running time for the rows of path confirmation was hour minutes and the rows that were not confirmed were ignored due to the aliases that schedulers use c testing preschedule workspace good morning my target testing date today is june th i am running in test p in local enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets rearranged to meet the new guidelines the daily deals i coded x in columns j and n the month long bookouts and bom bookouts i coded r what worked i was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact i had previously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from excel to the psw i was able to run the build route report with the criteria of starting on june paloverdeday of week mask activatedreport changes activated a check of deals actually scheduled vs build route results showed that all deals were extracted correctly from enpower because i am working on closed dates a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until production we are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarnation of build route the data extracted should be read only time stamped and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previously extracted data the improvement we are expecting to see is the app should not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow west light load currently does this in start view but not active view navigating around the scheduling sheet itself i was able to accurately execute the sort function on a single criteria at a time multiple sorting will contunue to be done in excel or we can do a series of single sorts in the psw to acheive the same result routing deals will had deleted all routes for june th starting me with a clean slate i made every path be for day i was unable to confirm total unrouted mwh as the real time position manager does not seem to be functioning in testp the routing appeared to take minutes with the status bar showing steady progress during that time this time is minutes longer than current speed using the excel macro system we have now the error list gave me a row by row description of what did not route a very useful tool ok was visible on all rows that the psw believed that it had routed i had difficulty checking the routing results as i kept getting bde errors in scheduling after routing had occurred local enpower scheduling kept starting up in i was unable to login to testp through terminal server but was able to in terminal server the results there were very encouraging most routing was done and a spot check of deals shows that they were routed properly the deals that were not routed appear to be due to a user error of deal number duplication in the sheet this is consistent with what i would expect i will further evaluate routing ability with our more complicated paths later this routing was very easy a large point with on peak non shaped deals only things i did not expect that i liked when i highlight a group of cells in build route it stays highlighted when i move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells this is very handy for double checking build route against the schedulers sheet what does not appear to be working at this time the physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up properly in routing path confirmation the running time appeared to be over one hour for one sheet only rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmation this current speed will not be sufficient to work in production also many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported and i cannot find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path confirmation when the path confirmation task was finished the application simply froze the status bar was no longer visible leading me to believe that it was done however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined further my conclusions the build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production the copypaste function works well for the west desk per our connectivity issues path confirmation is not functioning at this point and appears to be blowing up the app no data was visible for june th even after the psw ran through its import function please let me know when the issues i have named have been addressed and are ready for further testing thanks cara

california energy crisis california s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues what happened in california the source of california s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand california s economy grew percent since this increased the demand for electricity by percent at the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the result predictably is a shortage this summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state in addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis first the state s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility in california state regulation prevented this strategy this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price second retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remained in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt in short california s problems were caused by regulation not deregulation regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices at the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned the state s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives which if adopted would have averted the current crisis enron s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media here are the facts other than a small amount of wind power enron is not a generator in the state of california every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers as a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face we protected and still protect our customers from price volatility you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities here are the facts as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities this decision reduced ees s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates ees did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis enron continues to sign up customers in the state and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets enron s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs there has never been more demand for our products and services the solution the solution to california s crisis is also straightforward in summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state s utilities increasing supply california s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year in california it often takes to years california simply must streamline this process ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much nox california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is an open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today california should fully open its retail market reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk restoring the financial integrity of the state s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills this has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse price caps have been proposed they don t work have never worked and they will not work here price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california there is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education roads and other public goods which the private sector cannot do as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media it s important for you to know this we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state,0.9596629738807678,67788

wapas increased acitivities mike mcdonald and i met with wapa and the bureau of reclamation on tuesday and learned some interesting information about their relationship with pg e on oct th pg e filed to change the nature of the interconnect and banking agreement with wapa currently pg e looks at the imbalance energy positive or negative at the end of the month and then figures out what charges are due either party the imbalance account is calculated by aggregating mwhrs for the entire month as a result wapa would have a deficit in the account and then deposit a huge amount of off peak energy to balance out as of oct th all this changes wapa has to submit a balanced schedule on an hourly basis or else be subject to pg e imbalance prices which are probably a combination of contracts and spot prices i believe this means that wapa is going to have to be more diligent about its forcasts and more active in the real time and preschedule markets we probably need to gear up our relationship with the appropriate people over there to make sure that we are on their phone list stewart,0.9228180646896362,91342

player updates image latest nfl player news james stewart rb det updated stewart ankle is out for sundays game against arizona however coach marty mornhinweg stated that stewart is making progress and is getting closer to returning to action marco battaglia te cin updated battaglia appendectomy is out at least a month and may miss the rest of the season the big tight end has no real value as a fantasy player mark brunell qb jac updated brunell quadriceps will start on sunday against pittsburgh hell be facing a tough steelers secondary at less than percent however so fantasy owners may want to consider benching him in week fred taylor rb jac updated taylor groin practiced without incident on friday but he still needs medical clearance before he can play in sundays game against pittsburgh even is he is able to play however hed only be used on a limited basis stacey mack will get the start in any event so playing taylor on your fantasy team is not a wise move jerome pathon wr ind updated pathon foot is out for sundays game against new orleans according to the indianapolis star reggie wayne will start in pathons place once again james jackson rb cle updated jackson ankle will likely be a gametime decison on sunday against baltimore if the rookie tailback is unable to play jamel white will be clevelands featured back with benjamin gay getting some looks in the backfield as well correll buckhalter rb phi updated buckhalter has been suspended for this weekends game against dallas he is one of three eagles who will be held out of the game brian mitchell will likely serve as duce staleys backup jamal lewis rb bal updated according to published reports lewis has been suspended for four games lewis fourgame suspension went into effect on friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks or until dec instead lewis will work toward recovering from a torn acl in tennessee tyrone wheatley rb oak updated wheatley knee is out for sundays game with the chargers charlie garner will once again be oaklands feature back zack crockett may be used in goalline situations frank wycheck te ten updated according to published reports wycheck is expected to play half of sundays game against cincinnati that makes him a risky start from a fantasy perspective st ev e mcnair qb ten updated mcnairs status is still in question for sundays game against cincinnati due to an injured right thumb he threw the ball during individual drills friday and according to published reports is likely to play despite not being percent we dont recommend mcnair this week as a result emmitt smith rb dal updated smith will return to the lineup sunday against philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee cowboys head coach dave campo said after fridays practice that smith would be ready to play the majority of the game his return bumps troy hambrick to fullback but we wouldnt recommend you use either back against the stingy eagles rush defense frank sanders wr ari updated sanders hamstring was added to the nfl injury report on friday and is now listed as questionable for sundays game against detroit however if youre completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week sanders matchup against a vulnerable detroit secondary is worth considering as long as hes able to play chris weinke qb car updated according to published reports weinke will be the starting quarterback for sundays game against san francisco however hes not worth starting on your fantasy team daunte culpepper qb min updated culpepper is one pace for a good fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in minnesotas offense this season hes one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a fantasy perspective and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis cris carter wr min updated carters numbers may be down somewhat this season but hes still too good to ever consider benching the veteran has a knack for finding the end zone and should have a good game against rookie cb will allen and the giants secondary on monday night randy moss wr min updated moss is listed as probable for mondays game against the n y giants due to an ankle injury hes been underachieving this season but its almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid fantasy numbers ricky williams rb no updated williams is one of the better fantasy backs in the league and is a good player to use on a weekly basis hell face an indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long so williams is a muststart aaron brooks qb no updated brooks had a big game against san francisco last weekend throwing for yards and two scores he may be a bit inconsistent this season but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him especially against a vulnerable indianapol is defense willie jackson wr no updated jackson put up a huge game against san francisco last weekend posting catches and yards receiving hell face a questionable indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in week so starting jackson this week is a solid option stephen davis rb was updated davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly hes averaged yards rushing over his last four games and is once again emerging as a reliable fantasy player give him the start in week against a de nv er defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games tony banks qb was updated banks has played well of late throwing five touchdowns in his last three games hes got a good matchup this weekend against a denver team that can be beaten through the air but hes only worth considering in very deep fantasy leagues michael westbrook wr was updated westbrook has been inconsistent this season but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games hell face a denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering rod gardner wr was updated gardner has been held in check in his last two games catching only three passes for yards he does have a favorable matchup this weekend against denver however so starting him is a good move azzahir hakim wr stl updated hakim has been inconsi st ent in recent weeks so starting him on your fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right hell go up against a tough new england secondary in week ten so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues torry holt wr stl updated holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals but hes only scored only three touchdowns this season hell face a tough new england secondary this weekend but hes still worth starting on your fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers isaac bruce wr stl updated bruce hasnt put up the huge fantasy totals this season but hes still one of the better wideouts in the league hell face cb ty law and the formidable new england secondary but hes still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers marshall faulk rb stl updated faulk had a huge game against carolina proving that he is still the best fantasy player in the league hes a muststart every week and should post solid numbers in week against new england ernie conwell te stl updated conwell has had a few down weeks so starting him on your fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble with the lack of depth at tight end around the league however starting conwell is something many fantasy owners will have no choice but to do richard huntley rb car updated huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against san francisco but dont be surprised if he splits carries with nick goings avoid starting either back in week if at all possible more updates image copyright commissioner com inc and sportsline com inc

fascinating article writer makes the timeless observation that the devil may be in the details fascinating article supermodels why enron investors are running for the exits its all about risk and the houston energy company may be on the hook for billions bailing now and taking a share sellers reason is better than getting only pennies in bankruptcy by jon d markman http moneycentral msn com articles common bios asp in normal circumstances shares of houston energytrading titan enron should have stabilized around after it agreed to a merger with crosstown rival dynegy earlier this month instead the stock price is retreating faster than the taliban why the answer like everything associated with enron is complex but the short version is that investors fear that hidden problems will scotch the merger and force enron to seek bankruptcy protection potentially leaving its shares worth pennies while attention has so far focused on credit problems related to illdisclosed limited partnerships institutional investors are increasingly worried about risks enron faces in the market for financial derivatives known as swaps accentuating their concern billions of dollars worth of enrons nearterm swap contracts instruments that ironically were invented to help corporations limit risk will reportedly mature next month and are even more hidden from investors view than the deals that have gotten the firm into trouble so far on wednesday afternoon the bondrating agency fitch updated its opinion on enron by stating it believed there have been significant cash collateral calls from wholesale trading customers well in excess of previous expectations glenn reynolds chief executive of independent debtresearch firm creditsights and a former chief credit officer at lehman bros said the swaps market is a very large but arcane investment arena that isnt followed by mainstream corporate bond analysts or equity analysts yet he noted its one of the biggest things that can still go badly wrong for enron how much is enron on the hook for swaps exposure thus makes december a makeorbreak month for the company as its counterparties in complex deals glued together with billions in borrowed funds frantically attempt to unwind positions in markets as disparate as currency natural gas bonds and metals if enron either made the wrong bets on too many of these deals or contract covenants are breached that spur demands for hardasset or cash collateral the company could be forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy court to prevent a run on its dwindling treasury moreover because the world of swaps and derivatives is so incestuous with company a able to pay its hundreds of millions in derivatives obligations to company b only after it receives payments from company c some traders worry that enrons potential inability to pay off on its swaps liabilities could threaten the stability of the worlds commoditytrading system no one is saying that this worstcase scenario is bound to happen but rumors of default risk can spread like financial smallpox in nervous markets even if theyre never proved true one story making the rounds on trading floors for instance tied the historic collapse of u s government bonds in the third week of november to the belief that enron had to sell vast quantities of shortterm treasury notes to make good on swaprelated margin calls enron officials did not return calls for comment experts noted that enrons counterparty risks and scant disclosure on high levels of borrowing remind them of the spectacular blowup of hedge fund longterm capital management in which imperiled the world capital markets until the federal reserve captained a bailout that debacle ended when oncegenerous banks and brokerages finally turned off the money spigot said one veteran portfolio manager who asked not to be identified this is shaping up to be ltcm if enrons lines of credit dry up theyre out of business end of story lots of credit and lots of deals to understand the problem more clearly its important to understand what enron does for a living and the role and utility of swaps many investors think of enron as an energy company or gas utility but it has really operated more like a combination investment bank market maker and hedge fund in the past few years one of the key ways it earned income was its role in selling riskmanagement instruments those swaps as a solution for whatever financial impairments that a company fretted over lets say you run the riskmanagement operation of a metalmining firm and youre long copper futures as a hedge against the possibility that prices might fall in six months you want to lock in the price so you enter into a swap with enron under rules of the international swap dealers agreement or isda accounting protocols allow you to keep this trade off your balance sheet so its not disclosed anywhere for competitors or investors to monitor one of enrons roles was to find a company with the opposite problem to yours lets say they want to be short copper futures and make the match thus enron helped you swap a risk that made you uncomfortable for a risk that you felt you could control more often enron reportedly took the swap itself and laid off the risk by using some other hedge such as being long or short eurodollars or u s treasury notes it might also find it profitable to be the one responsible for actually delivering the physical product at its peak enron is said to have been a counterparty on thousands of swaps per week this business requires massive amounts of credit also known as leverage because margins are slim the only way to become supersuccessful is to do really big volume it turned out that few of longterm credit managements counterparties or bank lenders understood that the hedge fund had leveraged itself by as much as because of similar efforts to trade in high volume and likewise one veteran analyst who asked not to be identified told me that he believes enron might have been leveraged by as much as an astronomical in some cases thomas seims chief economist at the federal reserve in dallas and an authority on swaps told me that the crux of the issue is do we know exactly what their positions are and did they use swaps and leverage properly or improperly when we find out we can determine the potential for a contagion effect the big question how many deals why dont we know what their positions are legally theyre not required to reveal them and we already know that enron has done an absolutely terrible job of disclosing information that securities laws and investment community conventions actually require swaps are similar to the proprietary trading operation of major brokerages but with one critical difference typically stocks are fairly liquid and transaction terms do not vary much but swap contracts can have all sorts of covenants related to the creditworthiness of the counterparties so for all anyone outside of houston knows there could be any number of billiondollar deals hanging out there with rules that require enron to put up collateral or pay off loans if their debt rating falls below a certain rating threshold such as bbb one step above junk the surprise disclosure of such a clause in a previously hidden limited partnership contract over a brazilian deal is what caused enrons stock to plunge on tuesday according to traders more importantly one financial services executive pointed out because enron owns the market for many swaps spread options and other thinly traded financial instruments theyre the ones who set the marktomarket price that shows on their profitandloss statement for example every night an enron trader must mark the value of a year chicago naturalgas swap on his books there is no closing or settlement price theres only what the enron trader thinks the price should be it is in these marktomarket prices of thousands of swap positions that enron could theoretically hide hundreds of millions in unrealized losses if it chose to one prominent new york consultant to the energy riskmanagement industry told me hes estimated that enron could be forced to write off as much billion or more in failures related to its swap transactions why hasnt anyone focused on it the magnitude of enrons partnership problems is so great that after awhile you get numb and no one is paying attention to this part of their operation philip k verleger jr a leading energyindustry economist and consultant also noted that one reason that enron risks arent easily quantified is that they may not be price independent thats an economists way of pointing out that the company a major player in a corner of the derivatives business called delta hedging may not have the capital required to maintain a futures position in all the puts or calls it sold to commodity producers trying to offset risks that the price of things like natural gas or oil might fall or rise sharply if prices maintain above or below a level that enron forecast as likely to make it money in such a transaction no problem but if prices in the commodity change unexpectedly as oil prices did earlier this month then enron could find itself deep in the hole and forced to lean on thinning lines of credit to pay its obligation whirlwind merger deal no reassurance verleger isnt mollified by the notion that dynegy which agreed to merge with enron has studied the companys trading book thoroughly and decided it was fine dynegy probably was not able to see its whole book in a week he said added another trader who declined to be identified how anyone could do such fast due diligence is beyond me completely another trader speculated that auditors at dynegy a much smaller firm may have initially given enron a free pass on some disclosures because it was considered one of the cleverest and bestconnected companies in the nation with a chief executive who was a major financial backer and friend of president george w bush reynolds the creditsights executive said that investors should beware what he calls omission risk or the simple fact that what you dont see is what gets you every time he points out for instance that enron had a chance to tell investors about its ratingsrelated exposure in the brazilian deal during a conference call with investors last week but didnt it boggles the mind that they have kicked away every opportunity to rebuild confidence and credibility he said so what if gremlins pop out of the swaps closet reynolds believes that dynegy will use broadly written escape clauses in its merger agreement to walk away from its enron merger if unexpected swap defaults called fails in the business emerge he believes that enron would then find it necessary to seek the protection of bankruptcy court because no other merger partner or bank is likely to follow in dynegys footsteps to the altar in that event reynolds estimates enrons stock which traded for a year ago could quickly sink to less than from its current perch in the midsingle digits since holders of more than bonds and senior bank loans would stand ahead of shareholders in bankruptcy proceedings however he speculated that enron shareholders would be lucky to end up with pennies at the time of publication jon markman did not own or control shares in any of the equities mentioned in

updated warning window for the tagg deal entry when thursday november pm pm gmt central time us canada where eb the location is eb thank you this is a new day and time for this meeting thank you and i apologize for any inconvenience background a request was received by the gas tactical group that would have implications on the system you use the request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates if they are for a previous date would be beneficial to the requestor if they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms often times due to human error book admins see mistakes made where the trade date is and the terms are to because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the book admins to question this trade often times it is found that it was a mistake to date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for to request review is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date even a day before and not just for a different month thank you in advance monica clay x,0.7520886659622192,118797

wildhorse letter gerald i have provided a few coments redlined to your draft letter attached below however i wanted to offer the following ideas for discussion with you and the others listed above as to potential inclusion in the wildhorse letter a should we request written notification from wildhorse related to the shutin status of entrada production should we request written notification related to the recent curtailment of dakota production as weve discussed enogex never requested anything in writing from wildhorse so we do not have any historic documentation of wildhorses claims b should we identify potential contractual issues due to the curtailment of dakota production e g sec detailing the wellhead delivery pressure requirements under this contract et al as weve discussed the system pressures have increased due to initially gas being rerouted by wildhorse over the past two years which has loaded the san arroyo system and now the nwpl quality issues and subsequent wildhorse curtailments has increased pressures systemwide if wildhorse based their ability to allow these problems to persist by referring to sec gas quality of the agreement what remedies can we request partial release of dakota gas heres the frustration based on conversations with producers in the area and the documents weve received from enogex wildhorse has continued to attach nonpipeline quality spec gas to their system over the past couple years to increase gathering revenues yet has not invested any for processing of this gas to meet or exceed the specs of downstream pipelines then they use the downstream pipes as the reason for shutting in all their captive producers and have thus far offered no solutions to the system pressure and quality issues discussed above therefore its critical that this letter gets to the right people within wildhorse and if possible make reference to some element of timing e g reasonable dispatch commercially reasonable manner etc thanks dan endofsignature endofsignature,0.8246335387229919,131423

rto governance jim in denver you asked for our views on rto governance i e preference for stakeholder vs independent board as a basic principle i believe that the key issue is independence energy marketing generation ownership etc i have given each of these a grade from based on my preference forprofit transcograde the best form of governance is the forprofit transco it is governed by a independent corporate board and regulated by ferc independence is a fact of corporate structure and regulatory restriction the transco can take on delivery risk building new facilities as necessary to meet customer demand the transco is prohibited from taking any long term position in the energy market and it is compensated only by system through flow total load served and energy wheeled unfortunately i think the likelihood of transcos forming is remote the biggest obstacle is the difficulty of getting around the tax problems the llp llc structures skirts the tax problem but it also results in converting a sizable investment in to a passive investment with control by a minority owner i think the only way to get transcos in the short run is for there to be a short window years when transmission owners have the ability to sell assets to a company combining assets without taxes those missing the window would have to pay taxes on a presale merger transactions as they do now this would compel owners to determine if they want to be transmission owners and spin off could occur federal assets tva bpa wapa are unlikely to be spun off for some time if ever forprofitgridcograde i see this as a slight variant from an iso form like the transco independence arises from corporate structure and regulatory restriction on activities however i dont think it can take on much risk for delivery or congestion cost certainty the gridco will be thinly capitalized in comparison to the cost of the transmission system or the value of energy transmitted as a result its efficiency over the notforprofit iso is some share of operational benefits notforprofit iso with independent boardgrade this is actually very close tie with the forprofit gridco the best form i have seen is that proposed for rto west the members of the iso the customers and stakeholders select a nominating committee representing each class of members the nominating committee selects a search firm to proposed candidates who meet the conflict of interest standard the nominating committee elects directors from the slate of candidates every member of the nominating committee votes on every director a majority of the committee must agree to every director selected directors must stand for reelection every three years with staggered terms for the directors the board of directors is subject to open meeting requirements except for personnel matters an advisory committee is formed of the members but it is open to participation by all parties the advisory committee meets periodically by itself and with the board however any party may submit its views to the board on any matter the advisory committee serves as a forum for discussion but it is not a gate keeper determining what the board should be told there is no voting class structure for the advisory committee because it does not make recommendations as a group individual groups submit their views directly to the board notforprofit iso with stakeholder boardgrade this is a poor option far below the independent board the first caiso board showed it self to be largely paralyzed by the inability of the various stakeholders to vote for anything that would harm anyone as a result in my view they never really enforced the file tariff e g forming new zones when it was clearly needed however two worse forms exist notforprofit iso with state appointed boardgrade this is an even poorer outcome since state politics will prevent the iso from ever acting independently this kind of board will serve at the governors pleasure it will discriminate in the interests of a single state even if the board were appointed by multiple governors it would have no incentive to provide an efficient market to include multiple states an interstate compact is needed with congressional approval similar organizations northwest power planning council colorado river commission port authority of new york and new jersey etc have slow reaction times and are political driven notforprofit transcograde lacking an efficiency target imposed by a profit goal a notforprofit transco would tend to maximize the benefits for its own staff the management will want to extend the size of the enterprise to justify salaries and the staff will have few reasons to care about customer service this is the dmv this kind of agency will tend toward condescending paternalistic approaches to its services i e imposing the values of the staff on the response to any request for service steve,0.7220838069915771,146084

discussion of california background issues jim would it be logical to go back to march or whatever the date of the order was made that made this permanent and im not sure how it could hurt us with our customers they have a fixed price contract we absorbed this charge wouldnt the refund be ours discussion of california background issues bob for certain we are seeking to not have the c kwh surcharge post march i think that i would be happy to begin to try and get the cpuc to modify their order right now but my real concern maybe unfounded is that we dont want the cpuc to go all the way back to jan and refund the c kwh to direct access customers i thought this would harm ees given our dedasr activities this is what i mean by finessing the issue too much the only legitimate positions are no application back to jan or to fight for a cleanup after the retail rate freeze ends i make this based on the following first it is hard for ees to push much at the cpuc second after the cpuc takes what will be a potentially direct access killing action on aug i dont think they are going to be interested in dealing with a detail that matters for only for direct access customers finally i need to understand the value of this effort in line with the other key value drivers and also are you completely sure that there isnt a change however unforseen that could hurt another of our positions lets not create a fuss if the outcome could be harmful im ready to push for this but i want to make sure that everyone on the business side understands the issues jim discussion of california background issues jim first let me say that this is great for someone like me who is relatively new to california next with respect to item this implies to me that we are not seeking relief from the cent except for the postmarch time period have i misread this also i dont think a ruling by the commission either way could negatively affect our tax argument i view them as alternative ways to get to the same point discussion of california background issues attached please find the writeup on california the paper includes four sections background status upcoming issues recommendations legislative and regulatory history of california restructuring and summary of pg e enron correspondence on payment of negative ctc we have also pulled together most of the primary documents cpuc orders legislation etc that are discussed in this paper this material is quite lengthy and if anyone wants a copy please let me know i intend to send one to tim belden steve swain if we need to hold a meeting to discuss any of this ill be happy to set something up for tomorrow thanks jim endofsignature file background on california restructuring doc,0.9325590133666992,147910

meeting with edison john fielder re getting edison to pay us what were owed talked to john fielder svp at the utility this morning in an attempt to determine if edison will come around and pay us the px credit they owe us summary of our offer edison pays us of what they owe us as of payment structure edison pays us immediately with an agreed to speedy payment schedule for the remaining in return we drop our complaint against edison at the puc in return we agree to a bottomsup approach retroactive to march to replace the current px credit residual ctc framework fielder said that he didnt see any showstoppers in our proposal but had to check back on his end however there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal some agreement regarding payment of edisons undercollection this would cover any of our da customers who were bundled services customers prejanuary we agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the legislature and or the puc agreed that edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates some agreement on dwr stranded costs john expressed the view that dwr bought power under the assumption that the customers whove recently gone da would be there to take the power and now that theyve left they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs i told john that this issue is a hornets nest that we were better off leaving it out but wed consider his proposals some agreement on forebearance i told john that if edison agrees to pay us it didnt seem that forebearance would be off the table we agreed to touch base at the same time wednesday morning the idea is that hell get back to me with edisons reaction to our proposal and wed get back to him on edisons proposals might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions while john seemed very inclined to work something out all signals are that the legislature isnt inclinded to bail edison out next week in which case edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them on the other hand if the legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat an agreement might have real value any comments folks have on edisons proposals and whether it makes sense to continue discussions on wednesday are appreciated seems that at a minimum if we agree to consider edisons proposals then our payment should go from cents to cents on the dollar best jeff,0.779249906539917,148442

caem study gas dereg has saved consumers b ginger please send to ricks team jim caem study gas dereg has saved consumers b fyi the report is attached ngis daily gas price index published august caem study gas dereg has saved consumers b nearly years of competition in the natural gas market has reduced national energy costs by more than billion according to a new study issued monday this amounts to perhousehold savings of as a result of gas deregulation which began in the late s with the phased removal of wellhead price ceilings then graduated to lighterhanded regulation of interstate pipelines and now is focusing on opening up the distribution end according to the study commissioned by the center for the advancement of energy markets caem a nonprofit thinktank in washington dc the nearly years of competition weve experienced in the natural gas industry proves that the right conditions can foster lower costs for consumers and motivate the industry to make investments that benefit the environment our economy and our national security said caem ceo ken malloy in addition to the cost savings to the public the study credits deregulation for the rise in the number of gas suppliers at the wholesale and retail levels a reduction in longterm price fluctuations although it has triggered more shortterm price volatility greater focus on energyefficient purchases by customers making gas the fuel of choice for many and industry improvements in how its buys sells and trades gas supplies in addition it noted that lighthanded regulation of gas pipelines has been a big factor in passing through lower commodity costs to consumers in short the study reveals that the gas deregulation skeptics of the s and early s were wrong by a long shot according to caem what we also need to recognize is that weve witnessed a redistribution of wealth from foreign oil producers to domestic natural gas producers and that these lower prices have contributed measurably to a more stable inflation rate lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved our national security due to a reduced reliance on imported oil said malloy who formerly was on the staff at ferc and the u s energy department the study entitled california here we come the lessons learned from natural gas deregulation offers much guidance for the energy markets in the western state put the right regulatory framework in place half measures are more dangerous than doing nothing dont expect results overnight stay the course markets do work and consumers and the environment will be winners under properly executed reform the costs of change are easier to calculate than the benefits all the studies about gas deregulation underestimated the benefits and organized consumer advocates are often very wrong about the impact changes will have on consumers,0.9452565312385559,148776
transmission divesture and tax policy a couple questions could the company include distribution wires as well instead of being just a transmission only wires how many shares would a divesting company get could this be more that if so wouldnt this be over the control threshold in general i fully support this type of action jim transmission divesture and tax policy jim sarah and rick the following describes the suggestion that i made in our meeting this morning this is a strategy which could only be executed in legislation the problem one of the chief difficulties of forming a transco are the tax consequences of divestiture of assets the problem was identified in when we first started talking about a transco in the west if the parties agree in advance of divesture to combine their assets with others into a new company the divestiture creates a tax event as a result the transcos like alliance or transconnect have adopted an llc structure to avoid the tax consequences of formation the problem with the llc form is the reluctance of the owners to surrender all control of their assets to the managing member who has little skin in the game questions have also been raised by opponents about the fiduciary responsibilities of managing member are they to look out of the financial interests of the owners passive and active all these issues came up when we were working with various companies in on possible pipe wire companies the suggestion create a short window during which utilities could divest their assets into a transco without facing a tax penalty under such a provision current owners would be allowed to agree in advance to combine their assets to form a new company without taxes being levied on the spin off as long as the new company was a transmission only company the shareholders of the contributing companies would received publicly traded shares in the new company so there is no issue of the original company controlling the transco the federal treasury is tax neutral since without the provision the transco doesnt form when the shareholders of transco sell their shares the are taxable if the transco becomes more valuable then the benefit accrues to treasury in taxes on the sale of the stock with a two year window the companies would be faced with a one time opportunity to make the shift and avoid taxes this become a trigger for breaking up the vertical integration for which a business case can be made the shareholders of todays owners are better off thanks for listening reading steve,0.8252096176147461,148820

colorful dissent from two puc commissioners opposed to suspending da commissioners henry m duque and richard a bilas dissenting one could say that this order is consistent with the administrations present third world country mentality we are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market we are not convinced that the department of water resources dwr bond ratings depend on killing direct access this notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds direct access should be seen as a benefit to dwr it would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve dwr from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner something else is going on here we think that the dwr does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives it will make dwrs purchasing mistakes abundantly clear the commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by dwr finance and the treasurer instead the commission is making an ill informed panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later dwr and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if dwr is making prudent energy purchases only if dwrs contracts are too expensive relative to market will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices indeed retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on dwr to make more prudent purchases this is a very important consideration since ab x prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the dwr costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds if there is no yardstick how can anyone measure dwr performance the answer is one cant unless sb xx is signed into law we think that additional review of these issues before suspending direct access would have produced a more sound decision in the long run for these reasons we must respectfully dissent s henry m duque s richard a bilas henry m duque richard a bilas commissioner commissioner september,0.7844048142433167,162730

pg e proposed solution harry at the meeting yesterday we concluded that it would be a good idea to take the proposal that you put together based on your meeting with ees and use it as the base case to start running the numbers idea being that before we shop anything around we need to know what the numbers look like to determine whether the things got any legs once we have a clear understanding of how the base case numbers shake out we thought we might then want do some sensitivity analyses around the variables come up with a final proposal and then go back to the commercial groups for buyin we hoped that your folks could get together with roger yang et al and provide some assessment of what the base case numbers look like by middle of next week hows this plan sound few other points we assume that bullet s reference to net means that the deferral is calculated by taking any overcollections and subtracting them from any undercollections over the entire year period not yearbyyear what is the significance of the ctc rolloff date were assuming its commercially driven we correct if so whats the driver same goes for the ending date some tweeks were made to the proposal at the meeting to create an option for folks to consider though we dont think that any numbers need to be run on option until after having completed the analysis on option since those results could influence any scenarios we decide to construct option would keep the hydro with the utility and apply edisons proposed ratemaking treatment beginning make large customers noncore similar to the gas model in california and force those customers to choose an esp beginning introduce competitive default service for remaining core i e rez and small commercial customers finally couple of things that occurred to me after yesterdays meeting that i want to throw out for folks to react to seems that to be successful the proposal needs to remain as stripped down and simple as possible when the proposal nets out the deferral costs does it include the over undercollections associated with utility residual generation in option by adding the noncore feature and by implementing that feature and the default service feature prior to the ending date the proposal gets more complicated and adds significantly more risk to the utilitys position this is not to say that the complications cant be worked out or that the added risk cant be accounted for but wanted to highlight it for folks to consider attached is the original with just a couple of minor edits and option best jeff endofsignature,0.8777176141738892,164631

bond leg language etc greetings hope everyone had a pleasant th ive read the respective burton and hertzberg language on amending ab x the burton language looks cleaner and simpler though there may be reasons to include some of the hertzberg language too im proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill i would appreciate your feedback the amendments would be as follows customers who were on direct access when dwr started buying power jan th and are still on direct access when the bill passes should be exempt from paying for the bonds in short customers should not be forced to pay for power twiceonce from their esp and once from dwr since these customers receive power services from their esp they never consumed dwr power in the first place and it wouldnt be fair to require them to pay for it customers who have been utility customers since dwr started buying power but subsequently switched to direct access should only pay for power provided by dwr that they actually consumed no more and no less for example if a customer was a utility customer when dwr started buying power but switched to direct access on may st then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing dwr for power deliveries that took place from jan th thru april th i believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past weeks or if we didnt explicitly agree during the talks they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now and rather than leave the issue hanging which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers i suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers obligations are your thoughts are appreciated in addition we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get california out of the energy hole that it finds itself in providing kw and above customers with an incentive to switch to direct access as soon as possible could reduce the net short position that the state and ultimately consumers have to finance thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility reduce electricity purchasing costs and reduce the burden on the state budget with this in mind im also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to direct access by september st finally it seems odd that the language directing the puc to suspend direct access is still in the bill if a dedicated rate component is created that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend direct access and if thats the case would it make sense to delete that language from the bill look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the core noncore proposal best jeff,0.945218563079834,168835

portfolio scenarios jeff i hope this approaches what you were looking for i have included three scenarios a no hedge status quo scenario a scenario that allocates of the max short position july avg monthly peak to the and year contracts each and a balanced scenario that attempts to shape the various contracts to the load profile as i said on the phone today the price for all three of these is going to be roughly the same this is b c the swaps are based on the monthly curve which we are using as a proxy for spot prices so that all else equal a portfolio that is year fixed price will have the same allin price as one that is based on years of monthly prices however the volatility with the former is far less than with the latter the price graphs illustrate this to some degree but they still do not and cannot really accurately represent the volatility that the utilities will be avoiding if they hedge with a portfolio such as we are suggesting if you have any questions or need anything else please call cheers,0.8418923020362854,170779

mercury news wed light bulb moment commentary la times wed california trading wholesale power boost dukes earnings lawmakers debate efforts to save edison competing bills range from a straight bailout to purchase of transmission lines by jim sanders bee capitol bureau published july divided legislators began wrestling tuesday with competing proposals to keep one of californias largest private utilities southern california edison from going bankrupt pressure is rising as edison continues to struggle with more than billion in debt and a tentative plan by gov gray davis to buy the utilitys transmission lines for billion has attracted little support the question now is whether legislators will accept a modified version of the governors deal will approve an entirely different rescue plan or will simply let edison join pacific gas and electric co in bankruptcy court were encouraged that at least theres activity and people are grappling with the issues said john fielder an edison senior vice president the assemblys energy committee heard testimony on two of the competing proposals tuesday the senates energy committee will take up the third plan today the issue conceivably could be decided this week since legislators are scheduled to begin their summer recess friday of the three proposals under consideration one would authorize state purchase of edisons transmission lines one would provide an option to buy and one would simply tally edisons debts and charge ratepayers to pay them off some legislators favor doing nothing at all and letting a bankruptcy judge decide edisons fate steve maviglio a spokesman for davis said the democratic governor supports anything that comes close to the tentative deal hammered out in april to buy edisons transmission lines assemblyman fred keeley dboulder creek and assembly speaker robert hertzberg dsherman oaks have proposed a rescue plan that would buy the lines at a lower price billion and would modify the governors plan substantially key elements of the bill would allow the state to buy edisons hydroelectric assets if the transmissionline sale falls through allow businesses to contract with private suppliers for electricity in and commit the state to paying only cents of every dollar owed by edison to power generators the deal also would provide california with ownership or conservation easements to more than acres of land and would require edison to increase its supply of alternative energy such as wind or solar the proposal is not expected to spark new rate hikes keeley said the senate plan like the keeleyhertzberg proposal would require large and medium businesses to pay down much of edisons debts the senate plan dedicates up to billion in largeuser rates for debts involving banks and renewable energy sources known as qualifying facilities the plan written by sen byron sher dpalo alto seeks to leave edison with billion in debt from generators and marketers for the utility to work out on its own the senate plan would give the state a fiveyear option to buy edison transmission lines for book value about billion rather than provide conservation easements the plan calls for edisons environmentally sensitive acreage to be acquired by the state or a trust remaining parts of the proposal are similar to the governors deal a third proposal pushed by several lawmakers seeks to eliminate debt for edison and pg e it would not involve transmission lines conservation easements or other such elements advocates say edisons debt stemmed largely from failed state regulatory policies so the state should simply charge consumers a monthly fee to pay it off this is a straight bailout no hidden balls no extras said assemblyman rod wright dlos angeles it is not yet known whether that monthly fee could fit within the existing rate structure for home owners the amount is estimated at in the pg e service area and within edisons boundaries consumer groups are wary of the edison rescue proposals fearing the state will ultimately promise too much and get too little when a supermarket and dairy farmer both are forced to pay a year bailout tax the consumer pays more for milk said doug heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights the bees jim sanders can be reached at or jsanders sacbee com mailto jsanders sacbee com kevin yamamura of the bee capitol bureau contributed to this report pg e sues state over seizure of longterm power contracts by dale kasler bee staff writer published july reopening an old wound in californias energy crisis pacific gas and electric co has sued the state over a group of lowcost energy contracts seized almost six months ago by gov gray davis the lawsuit filed monday in san francisco superior court stems from the collapse of the california power exchange and the states entry into the powerbuying business in january pg e and southern california edison had entered into a series of longterm purchase contracts through the exchange a nowdefunct market for buying and selling electricity but as both utilities collapsed financially and the power exchange was clinging to life the exchange seized the contracts and was about to auction them off for nonpayment of bills thats when davis stepped in using his emergency powers the governor grabbed control of the contracts saying he didnt want them resold at inflated prices at the time the exchange said the contracts were worth about billion with pg es share set at million but its likely their value has fallen along with the spot market price of electricity back when the governor seized them pg es contracts were for to a megawatthour that was a bargain at the time and made the contracts very valuable now that spot prices have plunged those contracts are no longer such a great deal pg es lawsuit didnt put a value on the contracts nevertheless the state has benefited from the contracts said pg e spokesman ron low we should be compensated the state had planned to pay for the contracts at a price to be determined by a state government claims board said davis spokesman steve maviglio but he said the state also expected to be taken to court over the issue we always thought wed be fighting it out in a neutral forum maviglio said this comes as no surprise the bees dale kasler can be reached at or dkasler sacbee com mailto dkasler sacbee com energy digest advocate attacks utility rescue plan published july the states consumer advocate criticized gov gray davis proposed rescue plan for san diego gas electric on tuesday calling it too generous to the utilitys shareholders the public utilities commissions office of ratepayer advocates called the proposed deal with sdg e and its parent company sempra energy clearly excessive the advocate said the state goes too far in the core element of the rescue plan the billion state purchase of sdg es transmission lines the advocate said the money would be better spent building or buying new generating plants the plan must be approved by the legislature and puc a similar plan to buy southern california edisons transmission lines has run into numerous roadblocks in the legislature dale kasler hour of decision who will pay for costly power of past future published july in the next few days state lawmakers and regulators must make some unsettling choices about how to share the financial burdens of californias electricity debacle looking backward they will decide how or whether to erase billion in debts run up last year by southern california edison when it bought pricey power but couldnt pass the costs on to consumers looking ahead they will choose who if anybody will get out of paying for expensive power purchased by the state since the utilities ran out of cash last january in both cases the principle guiding the decision ought to be the same no one is blameless in getting california into this mess and no group can escape the pain of getting out of it democratic lawmakers in the assembly are searching in vain for ways to hide the real costs from voters their idea is to have the large users of power mostly big businesses pay off edisons past debts in return businesses would get some freedom to shop for cheaper power deals in the future the problem is that there wont be much opportunity to shop in the coming years thats because gov gray davis went out at the very peak of the market and bought up most of the states future electricity supply before it went on sale the strategy of locking most of californias power demand into longterm contracts seemed illadvised at the time even more so now now that the governor has done all this shopping the public utilities commission must assure that electric customers will pay for all that electricity billion worth of power over the next decade or so in addition the puc must commit customers to repaying the state for the power it has already purchased this year many billions on top of that the state borrowed from itself to buy all this power and is banking on a bond sale to pay off this debt unless a portion of the rate customers pay is dedicated to repaying those bonds they cant be sold this web of regulation contracts and finance is so complex so huge its hard to see how the energy leaders in a few days will find a graceful fair solution but for a political compromise to work all the interests involved must take some pain southern california edison must swallow some of its debt power generators and the state must renegotiate some of their longterm contracts so that the generators give back some of the bounty they reaped by market manipulation and no consumer big or small should be allowed to avoid paying the true costs of the power they use in this reckoning theres no easy way out for anyone and especially not for the elected officials who must deliver the bad news utility sues state seeking millions in seized power contracts objattph by david kravets associated press july san francisco californias largest utility sued the state tuesday seeking reimbursement of millions of dollars in energy contracts the governor seized jan san franciscobased pacific gas electric co said it has received no compensation for the damage to its property according to a suit filed in san francisco superior court the suit came as pg e which filed for bankruptcy protection in april struggles to repay billion in debt to thousands of creditors invoking constitutionally vested powers gov gray davis seized the energy contracts to keep the california power exchange from liquidating them the nowdefunct exchange which was the states middleman for the buying and selling of power wanted the contracts for itself to recoup hundreds of millions in unpaid power

buying its own promise power at rates below those being charged today by power generating companies because of the shaky financial pictures of pg e southern california edison co and san diego gas electric co the state in january began buying much of the electricity to supply the ratepayers of those utilities the power is sold to ratepayers through the utilities which reimburse the state

expected to sell billion or more in bonds to be repaid through increased consumer power rates under californias deregulation plan the states utilities sold many of their power plants and were forced

competing proposals to consider a plan introduced last week by assembly speaker robert hertzberg dsherman oaks los angeles county was debated for several hours yesterday along with a gopbacked alternative by assemblyman roderick wright dlos angeles the two plans which are scheduled for votes today in the assembly energy costs and availability committee take sharply different approaches hertzbergs plan would pay billion for edisons transmission lines to help cover the utilitys estimated billion debt the utility would be allowed to pay off its remaining debt by issuing bonds the utility would repay the bonds using ratepayer money for the first two years all customers would pay for the debt but after that the largest users would pay off the rest wright calls his plan a straight bailout it would allow the utility to issue bonds to cover all of its debt and impose a a month rate increase for all users until the debt is paid the senate also introduced its own plan a bill by sen byron sher dpalo alto would give the state a fiveyear option to buy the transmission lines and would have the state back only billion of the utilitys debt since davis announced a deal with edison earlier this year lawmakers business groups and consumer advocates have all expressed reservations with one aspect or another of it opposition has usually focused on the state purchase of edisons transmission lines the flurry of activity this week is an effort by lawmakers to take some kind of vote before they adjourn the edison agreement has an aug deadline for approval by the legislature brian bennett a spokesman for edison said creditors view that date as extremely important were as close to bankruptcy as our creditors want us to be he said is it a drop dead date i dont know but it is clearly an important date consumer groups have denounced wrights plan and at least one calls hertzbergs proposal just another bailout and said it would cost californians billion over the next years we cannot be seduced by big businesses paying a bailout tax said doug heller a consumer advocate with the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights at the end of the day we know businesses will pass these costs on to the consumer included in the page hertzberg bill are provisions that would allow large companies to buy their power directly from a provider instead of going through the utility after but a coalition of large business groups also said they are strongly opposed to the plan because it does not allow for immediate direct access ultimately we think our companies buying power for themselves is the best solution said jack stewart president of the california manufacturers and technology association if businesses think theres a light at the end of the tunnel where they see lower rates coming they might tough it out and stay wright argues that the beauty of his proposal is that it could easily apply to the pacific gas and electric co service area if the company wanted to use it as a way out of bankruptcy court he estimates that pg e customers would pay about a month to help the company pay off its debt this is a straight bailout wright said this is not a hidden bill there are extras wright said he believes his constituents would rather pay an extra than be unemployed because their business left the state due to high energy costs business groups said the idea makes sense what good would it do to have your electricity bill reduced by or but not have a job said bill hauck president of the california business roundtable whatever plan is eventually authorized would be used to convince the pg e bankruptcy judge to follow a similar model for that company giving the state those transmission lines as well the purchase of the transmission lines has been at the center of davis plan he argues that the purchase will give the state the ability to upgrade the system allowing a better flow of power between northern and southern california

traders say after scrambling this spring for every megawatt it could buy to stave off summer blackouts cool weather and decreased demand have left the state holding more power than it needs and selling the surplus for whatever it can get state officials wont say how much they are selling the power for but acknowledged unloading surplus electricity were seeing certain times of the day where we may not need power that we previously thought we needed and were selling it on the open market said oscar hidalgo spokesman for the state department of water resources were probably moving a little more power than we anticipated but i dont think anybody anticipated a july like were experiencing utilities routinely sell surplus contract power when demand is lower than expected but the states recent selloff could fuel criticism that california bought too much power at too high a price fearing rolling blackouts and soaring prices this summer theres a painful lesson to be learned when you overbuy when supplies are tight said gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum anybody can lose money in this business and the state of california is getting a taste of that the state in the past week has sold anywhere from to percent of its available power hidalgo said on tuesday the state had up to megawatts available while demand hovered around megawatts according to the power grid operator must be sold because electricity cannot be stored power purchased in contracts for a later date would be wasted if not used or sold its better than losing it altogether hidalgo said the way the electricity business is set up you either use it or move it you cant put it in a bottle and put it on a shelf state officials would not say how much theyve made in sales to offset purchase costs citing concerns about jeopardizing their bargaining position according to california energy markets a trade weekly the state was unloading power last thursday at per megawatthour

for californias biggest utilities in january expected to sell surplus power from time to time although not quite this much hidalgo said even with demand down the state still is buying more power than it sells he said with temperatures throughout the west unseasonably low in recent weeks other utilities also are selling their surplus power at a loss thats an accepted operating risk we always assume said scott simms spokesman for portland general electric adding that recent federal price caps are lower than what the oregon utility paid sometimes you gain sometimes you lose hopefully if you planned well you end up winning whether the state planned well or overbought is hard to say the contracts could prove invaluable if another heat wave threatens blackouts ackerman likened power contracts to insurance a prudent move to guard against shortages and price spikes even if it turns out you dont need it at the very least the current situation underscores the importance of weather in the volatile electricity market traders pore over forecasts and even buy weather insurance ackerman said demand and prices have been so low that some energy companies are shutting down the small power plants called peakers hidalgo said the state has no regrets what we were doing was making sure we had an available supply with these contracts hidalgo said we were facing scarcity in the market early on there wasnt enough supply to fulfill the need what the contracts have done is obligated the producers to give us power blackout threat fades the states daily power costs have fallen from more than million in may to less than million in july hidalgo said and there hasnt been a blackout in two months while some of the surplus power is sold on the market it is also being traded to northwestern hydropower utilities to cover past debts he said this is not a bad position for us to be in hidalgo said adding that the situation could always take a turn for the worse we cant lose sight of the fact

promises of new technologies earlier former gov pete wilson focused on the past as he offered people at the public policy institute of california a rambling defense of the electricity industry restructuring law he signed at the heart of electricity industry restructuring is a traditional republican theme a preference for market forces and competition over regulators and government planning but the fate of californias electricity industry restructuring plan now rests in the hands of gray davis the states democratic governor abraham never mentioned davis i didnt come here to play the blame game he said in a news conference californias electricity problems are merely the most intense in a nation facing rising demand stagnant supplies and an energy infrastructure that is out of date and in need of repair he said picking up on an initiative that has emerged as a priority for some advocates of restructuring abraham stressed the need for enhanced federal authority to meld regional networks of highvoltage transmission lines into a national grid but abrahams main pitch was that california technology companies could contribute intellectual capital and ingenuity to the world of megawatts looking far into the new century he offered a vision of an energy industry replete with micro turbines fuel cells and hybrid engines our carbonbased economy itself may pass from the scene to be replaced perhaps by a hydrogen based economy he said wilsons concerns were more prosaic he defended restructuring now plagued by soaring prices and rolling blackouts as a step forward from the previous structure where electricity came from regulated monopolies there were flaws wilson said of the restructuring bill that he signed into law in i acknowledge that they were less important than launching california on the path to deregulation restructuring was the only way to bring down power costs that were higher than in other states and to break a regulatory logjam that had limited power plant development he said wilson criticized the laws retail rate freeze although it triggered a financial crisis for the states utilities the freeze was largely a selfinflicted wound insisted upon by utilities seeking to be repaid for costly investments in nuclear plants and contracts with small generators he said wilson also said it had been a mistake to forbid the utilities to sign longterm contracts with generators those were ruled out because regulators feared such contracts would give utilities an unfair advantage as competition developed he said noting that he had been singled out for criticism by davis wilson fired back saying that davis had been too slow to invoke the virtually dictatorial powers that the governor has in emergencies including electricity shortages but wilson expressed some sympathy for davis noting that the legislature would not have allowed faster power plant siting and construction without a crisis he also grudgingly complimented his successors political skills i admire gov davis ability to conduct public relations wilson said noting that a visit by president george w bush had turned into an absolute public relations triumph for the governor wilson echoed some of davis themes under presidents clinton and bush the federal energy regulatory commissions response to the crisis had been a bit slow off the mark wilson said there remain unanswered questions about the role of natural gas suppliers and whether shortages and high prices in california resulted from artificial or real constraints on pipeline capacity he added generators while not the cause of the crisis should also be held to account if people have been guilty of gouging they should pay up he said wilson said the current troubles are a symptom of the states failure

on an edison rescue said assemblyman fred keeley dboulder creek who coauthored one of the lower houses rescue bills with assembly speaker bob hertzberg dsherman oaks one indication of the lack of enthusiasm for the legislation is that keeley himself does not support the measure that bears his name i dont believe that this bill in its current form should become law he said this bill is not ready the maneuvering in both houses thursday capped a day of frenetic activity in the state capitol which has become flooded with cell phonecarrying lobbyists seeking to influence the edison deal for seemingly every special interest in the state yet amid the flurry of action there seemed little chance of actually making law many of the participants said the legislative debate appeared to be less

court leaders of each house could argue they were not to blame hoping to head off a growing sentiment among lawmakers that bankruptcy may not be such a bad alternative gov gray davis spent the day working the phones in hopes of persuading legislators that a government rescue of edison would be good for the state to avoid mass blackouts california has been purchasing billions of dollars worth of electricity since the beginning of this year because the states two largest private utilities edison and pacific gas electric are no longer creditworthy enough to buy power on behalf of their customers the utilities lost that status and ran up billions in debt the last two years because they were paying high prices for power on the wholesale market and could not recover those costs from customers because of a stateimposed rate freeze as a result the state government is stuck in the powerbuying business until the utilities regain their financial footingan expensive predicament that threatens the states financial health davis attempted to head off the crisis by negotiating rescues of the two utilities but pg e lost faith in the talks and opted to take itself into bankruptcy court in april embarrassing the democratic governor days later davis reached a tentative rescue deal with southern california edison but the plan hit the legislature with a thud amid concerns it was overly generous to edison and it has languished for months last week lawmakers finally picked up the pace and began moving forward with a series of competing proposals to alter the governors deal with edison

financial predicament were bailing out people who dont need to be bailed out said sen ross johnson rirvine legislative leaders hoped to pass something before today when the assembly and senate are

chief executive of saber partners which is advising the governor said the latest numbers indicate that there is enough money in current rates to implement the governors plan to pay for the utilitys debt as well as the states current and future power purchases even if the water department allocation still left room for edison to pay off its debts such a course of action would require approval by the state legislature and the public utilities commission although energy trends appear to allow the utility to regain its financial footing analysts cautioned that the utility still could find itself in bankruptcy court if the state doesnt provide a method for edison to pay its debts while we might be able to cover our costs going forward it is equally important that we have a way to pay off that billion debt said brian bennett an edison vice president but without knowing what the water departments revenue needs are we wont know what is left over in rates to cover our costs bennett blamed the utilitys socalled undercollectiondebts that piled up as frozen consumer rates could not cover soaring wholesale electricity costson what he called flawed regulatory policies based on recent energy prices bennett said we are just only beginning to repay the undercollection the recently enacted rate increases which kicked in last month have pushed what edison can charge customers for the electricity component of their bills from about cents a kilowatthour to cents at the same time declining natural gas prices have sliced in half what the utility must pay to a group of small and alternativeenergy companies that generate about of its electricity needs edison for example paid this group cents a kilowatthour in february that dropped to cents by may and now stands at about cents each penny decline in the cost of electricity from this group of generators represents more than million in savings for edison on an annual basis bennett cautioned that if the water department requires additional funds or if edisons energy costs were to turn upward again then rates once again may not be adequate to cover our generation costs it is therefore imperative that this uncertainty

edison to use a portion of the rates it is collecting to pay off a bond offering would meet the objection of some consumer groups which label the concept a corporate bailout just as the utilities gambled on deregulation and were winners at first edison now has to be responsible for its losses said harvey rosenfield president of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica he said bankruptcy court is the most appropriate place for edison to resolve its financial problems several creditors of the utility however said that as long as edison can tread water or even work down its debts there is little incentive to put the company into bankruptcy which would only add another legal layer and more expenses to an exceptionally complicated situation creditors could move against the company if they believed its finances were declining and thus shrinking the amount of cash and assets that could be distributed in a bankruptcy proceeding they also could put edison into involuntary bankruptcy if some creditors exacted payment from the company ahead of others that are owed money more inside powerful computers regulators will track realtime prices a edison on hold

sacramento body lawmakers moved with lightning speed yesterday to undo a plan that would force california regulators to raise electricity rates whenever state power buyers deem it necessary a hastily introduced bill pits democratic lawmakers against the administration of gov gray davis which is counting on the state public utilities commission to approve rate increases to pay for electricity without questioning whether the state got a good price historically utilities bought their electricity and asked the puc to approve rate hikes the puc decided whether the requests were justified but with the utilities now deeply in debt and the state buying electricity the old system has broken down this week the puc issued a draft agreement that would guarantee the state would get as much money as it needs to pay for the electricity it is buying consumer advocates said the proposed agreement would force the puc to cede its responsibility to protect customers from unreasonable rate increases senate leader john burton dsan francisco called the agreement overreaching by the governors department of water resources which is buying the states power under burtons bill consumers would still have to repay billion in bonds that the state plans to float to cover its purchases but the bill would allow the puc to scrutinize the states expenses beyond those covered by the bond costs mounting to billions of dollars over the next to years the bill passed out of two committees with bipartisan support yesterday and now faces a vote by the full senate both business and consumer groups expressed their support for the measure this is better for ratepayers said lenny goldberg of the utility reform network it makes the bond issue secure and gives a chance to look into all of the contracts puc commissioner richard bilas said some change is needed to restore commission oversight the only check and balance on the department of water resources as it is would be the governor bilas said i think it takes a different branch of government to do that oversight but bruce van dusen a lawyer hired by the department of water resources said burtons bill could delay the bond sale and jeopardize the general fund the concern is that while burtons bill guarantees that the bond issue would be repaid it does not spell out how all the longterm electricity contracts that the state has signed will be

best interest so reads a proposal between the dwr and the state public utilities commission released earlier this week that could go into effect next month and has both puc members and public advocacy groups worried this gives an unelected unaccountable state agency the unilateral right to order rate increases for the next years harvey rosenfield president of the foundation for taxpayer and

process are scheduled to be released by the dwr on friday loretta lynch puc president and oscar hidalgo a dwr spokesman both said they believe current electric rates cover the states power buying costs for now but the thought of a state agency potentially hitting residents and businesses in the pocketbook without any oversight so troubles sen john burton dsan francisco that he is pushing legislation that would retain the pucs authority to say no since january the dwr has spent more than billion buying electricity for the customers of three financially ailing utilities it will likely spend billion to supply californians with electricity over the next years the puc raised rates twice already this year money which the utilities pass along to the dwr to help it pay its debts but in order for the state to issue some billion in bonds later this summer it must show wall street that it has a solid stream of money rolling in that will cover its powerbuying needs ratepayers will pay off those bonds over years and state officials say a solid revenue stream could help keep interest low the puc dwr proposal gives the dwr a state agency whose director is not elected critics point out the ability to ask for rate increases that would essentially be rubberstamped by the puc with a to day turnaround this authority to pass through costs without cpuc review would never be permitted for costs incurred by a utility burton wrote burtons bill would set aside a certain amount of ratepayer revenue to go to dwr rather than steering the entire amount in its direction power buying expenses

in the sand and the level of the lake was basically right here at that point in time i could bring my motor boat into here and actually winch it into the boathouse for the winter now if we look in the distance behind me youll see how far out my motor boat is now margo mcdiarmid tyke drever has seen his lake change a lot over the years the water is simply disappearing drever that used to all be lake bottom that was all lake bottom there was water covering all that but not has turned into green grass mcdiarmid drevers home is on lake wabamun about kilometers west of edmonton one of the regions most popular recreation spots its also the site of three coal fired power plants owned by transalta two of them right on the lake the coal comes from the mine right across the bay drever and his neighbours have an ongoing battle with transalta canadas largest private power company they blame transalta for blocking streams that drain into the lake for sucking up water to make power drever i think it would be fair to say that probably the mining is the starting point of the problems because nobody knows what in actual fact what the mining has done to the natural mother natures inflow influx of water into the lake mcdiarmid and now therell be an even larger power plant just down the road transalta wants to double the size of its keephills plant adding two new generators like these alone theyd be enough to power a city the size of edmonton linda duncan wabamun lake resident id rather have the lake back unidentified man id rather have the lake back too mcdiarmid drever and other members of a local group dont like the thought of an even bigger power plant nearby drever they will say that the keephills plant is outside of the watershed area of the lake wabamun question mark we dont know that bob calhoon wabamun lake resident it scares me mcdiarmid why is that calhoon because weve seen the damage that is done now with the plants we have here now what kind of damage is going to be done when they expand these plants even greater than they are now mcdiarmid transalta hasnt built a new plant in years because of uncertainty over deregulation now the rules are clear power is bought and sold by private companies with an energy shortage in alberta transalta is ready to expand mike kelly transalta we have such a shortage of electricity and demand is so high that we thought we really had to move to do something about that to fill the gap mcdiarmid transalta says most of its new power will stay in alberta any extra will be exported to b c and then possibly to california but americans want more from any alberta company willing to sell with natural gas prices going up cheap alberta coal power is a hot item murray smith when the americans come to visit you they dont come for tea and they want things mcdiarmid energy minister murray smith says alberta will help them out at a recent gathering of energy ministers smith pointed out the province is ready to cash in on the export business smith i think that exports are actually in the long run a good thing for alberta to be able to reach out with exports allows us to build the grids build the inner connects and then allows us to generate more power that will give albertans lower prices mcdiarmid and theyre already lining up to buy albertas power the national energy board is now juggling seven applications for export licenses to bring power from alberta to the u s and more than half are from big american companies one of the largest is morgan stanley an international investment bank based in new york morgan stanley wants a year export license from the national energy board the plan buy up extra power in alberta and sell it to california brian stazinski clean air coalition i think theyre profiteers theyre coming in here and asking for about three percent of our supply to sell to the united states and when we ask them where are you getting supplied from they go hm we dont know we dont care were just going to get a piece of the action and make some money on this whats cost effective about continuing to generate all kinds of emissions mcdiarmid brian stazinski is an environmentalist named on of time magazine six heroes of the planet for his work with conservation but now hes taken on new work to stop morgan stanleys export application and others like it because exports mean building more plants and burning more coal stazinski its just fast track approval all the way to the bank and so were going to see a lot of developments if the morgan stanleys get their way i dont think the people of alberta understand that pat spilstead wabamun lake resident so many of these things are now sensible mcdiarmid the residents of wabamun lake understand it they just have to look out the window transalta is expanding one plant now the power will mostly stay in alberta but no one around this table thinks it will stop there drever at five or six applications a year its not unreasonable to assume that there might be eight plants around the shore of this lake i mean where does it stop duncan were swamped and we keep saying whos there in the government of alberta and the government of canada to represent the interests of the public of alberta spilstead where do the economics become more important than the environment now were an isolated little problem but maybe a perfect example of a great intrusion on the alberta environment mcdiarmid and critics say the environment will pay the price alberta coal is considered cleaner because it has low amounts of chemicals that cause smog but burning it still creates a long list of toxins like particulants tiny bits of dust that can lodge in the lungs theyre considered a toxic substance coal power increases carbon dioxide linked to global warming and then theres mercury its linked to birth defects and nerve damage new research by federal committee on mercury shows that among the provinces albertas coal plants generate percent of all the mercury in the country the highest rate in canada environmentalists are pushing for a public debate on exporting power stazinski they should have a say about whether or not we should be digging up our farm land burning the coal getting all of the emissions so that the americans can get the benefits of the electricity people of alberta should have an opportunity to say whether or not thats a good idea unidentified man anything you didnt understand or anything you need to clarify mcdiarmid power companies are well aware the public is nervous unidentified man i was just wondering how much increase of mercury mcdiarmid transalta is hosting meetings to answer questions its promising the keephills plant will use state of the art technology to keep its pollution to a minimum kelly there are new standards that have been put in place by alberta environment and were going to meet those standards and were going to put on some some pretty solid technology actually to control our emissions drever come on kilt come on that a girl mcdiarmid it will get busier in the lake wabamun area transalta wants to open its bigger plant in four years the company says the keephills plant and the mine are too far away to affect the lake in fact its now putting some of the water back to raise the level tyke drever would like to think thats true drever wouldnt it be wonderful if in my lifetime i could see this water lapping at those piers again lapping at those railway ties again and my kids kids playing in water at the edge here kiltie come on kilt mcdiarmid drever is also realistic he knows theres a big thirst for electricity its very political new projects will be hard to stop and he wonders what price in the end alberta will have to pay for its power drever its

power contracts byline by dana bartholomew body california suddenly faces an energy surplus forcing the state to sell power it bought for an average of per megawatt for as little as a dollar electricity traders say in fact the state has sold its unused power so cheaply that the los angeles department of water and power which has made tens of millions selling power to the state during the crisis has become an occasional buyer of power from the state at rates below its normal costs state officials acknowledged that cool temperatures and the surprising success of conservation efforts have glutted the energy market in the past week but they dismissed the surplus as a blip they said they are getting to per megawatt for up to megawatts a day during the earlymorning hours losing millions of dollars on power purchased in recent months under longterm contracts both and have occurred said gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum which represents many generators and utilities that sell millions in power to the state each day it gives californians a great glimpse of what happens when the state moves into private industry they legislators do the right thing politically and it backfires economically he said critics say the state in an effort to capture runaway wholesale energy costs this spring locked in power at too high a price ultimately ratepayers of such private utilities as southern california edison will be forced to pick up the tab we think its an outrage said kris vosburgh of the howard jarvis taxpayers association the governor went willingly into these agreements and tried to prevent the public and the press from seeing them and didnt ask for public or expert participation now its the ratepayers that are paying for his mistake the state assisted by former los angeles dwp general manager david freeman has negotiated more than billion in such contracts that stretch as far as state officials disputed the rockbottom rates quoted by forum traders im looking at the average price and it far exceeds a dollar said oscar hidalgo spokesman for the state department of water resources which now spends million a day on power down from million in may this is an overall blip on our picture here gov gray davis defended the states purchases saying through spokesman steve maviglio that they had stabilized the market like we said all along were doing everything within our power to control the situation and stabilize things he told the new york times but the weather is not within our control when the utilities were in this business they ran into this situation routinely while the state once spent most of its money for energy on the volatile spot market it currently buys percent of its power under longterm contracts unlike natural gas electrical energy cant be stored and must be passed on when usage fails to meet expected demand during a cooler summer for example suppliers are forced to accept whatever price they can get for the surplus sometimes at a loss some of that loss hidalgo said was to pay back power loans from the federal bonneville power authority in washington state while the state admitted shedding up to percent of its power since july ackerman said that up to megawatts a night of surplus power was previously laid off selling surplus power is common to any utility or acting utility in the energy business california energy markets a trade weekly said the state sold such power july at a megawatt critics have called the state contracts with energy generators turkeys for locking in power

late the states major investorowned utilities had already amassed more than billion in debt from runaway power costs and were out of credit davis and the legislature launched a massive state power purchase program a speedup of new power plants conservation subsidies and other actions not all of which have successful but everyone involved knew that the utilities debts which had driven them to the brink of bankruptcy would be the most complex and politically difficult aspect of the crisis six months later thats still true an administration team negotiated for weeks with pacific gas and electric and southern california edison on schemes to retire their debts and bring them back to a creditworthy status the talks with pg e went nowhere and three months ago the huge san franciscobased utility filed for bankruptcy davis clearly concerned that edison would follow hammered out a deal with the smaller utility within hours it was by any standard a sweet deal for edison and its parent company edison international too sweet for just about everyone in the legislature and immediately efforts began to change it edison lobbyists worked the legislature and the utility cranked up a massive advertising and public relations campaign to no apparent avail and davis oddly pulled back from the fray the governor concentrated on another aspect of the crisis with greater political sex appeal demanding that generators many of whom are pg e and edison creditors be forced to repay many billions of dollars because as he put it they had gouged the state ultimately davis campaign failed although his strident advocacy did apparently arrest his decline in public opinion polls meanwhile the edison deal languished with the legislature now poised to leave sacramento on a monthlong summer recess and a selfimposed deadline for enacting the edison plan approaching the capitol is newly aflutter with efforts complex doesnt even begin to describe the situation there are at least three alternative plans kicking around none of which can be passed as written davis may be willing to accept almost anything that would save him from the embarrassment of another utility bankruptcy on his watch but currently backs a scheme ginned up by assembly democratic leaders edison however has split with davis and now favors an alternative offered by republicans and some moderate democrats one that consumer advocates denounced as a corporate bailout meanwhile liberal senators are pushing another version that edison likes even less but its critics among consumer activists like more with both lawmakers and outside interest groups so widely scattered over what if anything should be done to rescue edison a consensus developed late thursday to keep the vehicles alive with preliminary floor votes but continue private negotiations through the monthlong vacation recess the manysided stalemate stems from both the rivals plans provisions farmers for example fear environmentalists gaining authority through the state over edisonowned watershed in the sierra and the convoluted dynamics of the capitol legislative leadership is very weak in the era of term limits especially in the assembly and lawmakers are leery about voting for any complex utility measure particularly one that might raise rates some call it disease for the number of the deregulation bill that backfired so badly then too some liberals and consumer activists appear to want all of the measures to fail forcing edison into bankruptcy court then they believe the newly created but still inactive state power authority could step in using its billion in untapped bonding authority and pick up assets of the utilities on the cheap thus creating a massive state utility system wheels within wheels and none of them

california settlement i spoke with john nimmons regarding the subject settlement discussions on tuesday he shared with me his view on several matters hes not sure what sce is up to he believes they will not move off of their position of dg ownership however convoluted it may be basically they want to keep the option open of customerside dg ownership he also believes they most likely will not participate in further discussions he has a call into sce to see if he can come to some understanding on where they stand he also said they indicated they are most likely going to drop out of dpca john believes pg e was responding to the commissions position regrading dg ownership as outined in the cmmissons rule that states the commission has not found any compelling reason to prevent ownership of dg bu udcs he thinks they are not interested in customerside dg as a business but only as an option to site mobile dg under emergency conditions he also believes that this issue is not a showstopper for them and they would most likely give it up dg ownership if others such as dpca and enron would support a pbr that gave them the right incentives next mondays meeting will focus on the distribution only wheeling tariff issue minutes of the last meeting and an agenda for mondays meeting should be out today he thinks this will be the most contentious issue of all based on his reading of the utilities testimony the utilities postitions are that you cant separate distribution from transmission when dealing with the grid since their is much interdepence i think we should continue to participate in these meetings im planning on participating by phone i dont expect sce to participate but if we change pges ownership position we would have of the utilities with us which strengthens our position it will also be interesting to see what the utilities have to say regarding distribution only tariffs any thoughts,0.9473294615745544,174170

nfl news image image please visit our sponsors count on medstrong to save your life medstrong is for anyone interested in safe emergency care for themselves and their families click here dear joe stepo here is the latest nfl news from the associated press raiders oakland kicker sebastian janikowski fell at a nightclub due to an apparent drug overdose cutting his face and requiring five stitches a few hours after the raiders game against dallas police said tuesday janikowski was taken to a hospital after patrons at the snodrift bar reported he had collapsed early monday morning police spokesman dewayne tully said janikowski who attended team meetings later monday was not arrested tully said a police report indicated the clubs doorman told officers that janikowski was possibly overdosing on ghb the socalled daterape drug last april in florida janikowski was found innocent on charges of drug possession and evidence tampering in april in florida after being accused of possessing ghb in the police report monday officers wrote they found janikowski incoherent and wildly flailing around on the floor as a result of the uncontrolled flailing janikowski hit his head on the floor and caused a cut over his right eye janikowski did not respond when officers talked to him and he was placed in soft restraints on a gurney for the trip to the hospital the police report said janikowskis roommate jay hoffman told police the kicker was not taking drugs but that he was with an unidentified woman earlier in the night who may have slipped something into his drink other witnesses told police they saw janikowski voluntarily taking what appeared to be ghb and that he does it all the time paul healy the kickers agent said janikowski needed stitches for a head wound he said his client had been drinking and said reports of a drug overdose were totally false i know he was out there at a nightclub in san francisco and slipped and fell at a lot of these clubs people spill their drinks and he slipped and whacked his head healy said you dont have a drug overdose sunday night and go to practice monday morning raiders coaches said janikowski appeared fine monday the kicker who has made all eight of his field goals this season was not in the locker room in the hour that reporters are allowed access on days following games janikowski a native of poland was oaklands firstround choice in the draft after starring at florida state in june janikowski was acquited on a charge he offered a tallahassee policeman to release his roommate after an argument with a bouncer who wouldnt let him into a local nightclub his contract includes a clause that will force him to pay back about for every game he misses due to suspension the clause was added because of his runins with the law chiefs starters derrick alexander tony richardson and dante hall will probably be out sunday when kansas city plays host to pittsburgh the loss of alexander last years team mvp and the chiefs only experienced wide receiver will send the chiefs into the weekend dangerously short at the position sylvester morris last years no draft pick has been out all year with a knee injury marvin snoop minnis this years top pick has been inconsistent inconsistency at wide receiver has been cited by coach dick vermeil as the top reason for quarterback trent greens problems green threw four interceptions last week in denver it really makes us thin at wide receiver said vermeil we count on hall as one of our four wide receivers but now we cant do that alexander slowed all season with a sore achilles tendon developed back spasms during pregame warmups last week before the chiefs loss at denver although alexander played vermeil said he couldnt bend over and tie his shoelaces on monday fullback richardson the chiefs most consistent performer on offense also missed last weeks game with a shoulder injury hall a wide receiver kick returner has a deep contusion on a shoulder that has already undergone surgery it would take drastic change to all of a sudden have tony richardson back vermeil said i think its a better chance of having him a week from this weekend the only healthy wide receivers left are minnis chris thomas and larry parker tight end mikhael ricks will probably be used in the position the chiefs will be reduced to using defensive backs as wide receivers during practice but vermeil said he did not anticipate bringing in another wide receiver the problem with bringing guys in is you have to let somebody else go who if guys are injured and go on injured reserve they create their own roster vacancy vermeil said but who do you want to sacrifice its not an easy thing to do then if you do bring somebody in will he suit up on sunday when you bring them on the roster and he cant automatically line up and play this weekend because he doesnt know the scheme that really hurts you one possibility would be derrick mayes signed to a freeagent contract last spring the former seattle starter was released after training camp weve talked to mayes in the past about being in shape and being available vermeil said he would be a logical guy because of his knowledge of our scheme but who would we let go vermeil said parker would probably return punts but rookie running back derrick blaylock could be activated reserve running back mike cloud was expected to return kickoffs richardsons loss is felt throughout the offense tony richardson might be the best player at his position in the league vermeil said we miss his leadership we miss his running we miss his blocking its not easy to just plug somebody in cowboys rookie quarterback quincy carter is expected to be out two weeks for the dallas cowboys after straining his left hamstring in the loss against oakland anthony wright who replaced carter in the first quarter is set to face washington in his third start of the season carter had a mri on monday to determine the injurys severity my teammates know i can play he told the dallas morning news on tuesday they know i have talent ive just had some injury problems carter had returned to the lineup on sunday after missing two games with a bruised thumb during an yard run in the loss to oakland carter strained his hamstring he finished the drive but did not return on his first play wright threw a yard touchdown pass to joey galloway who ran past pro bowl cornerback charles woodson anthony showed us that he can come off the bench and play with a limited number of repetitions in practice coach dave campo said wright completed of passes for yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions he has been the quarterback when dallas scored of its points this season cool new remindersgreat quotes of the daytravel digestpet tips

the empty chair the empty chair a mans daughter had asked the local minister to come and pray with her father when the minister arrived he found the man lying in bed with his head propped up on two pillows an empty chair sat beside his bed the minister assumed that the old fellow had been informed of his visit i guess you were expecting me he said no who are you said the father the minister told him his name and then remarked i see the empty chair i figured you knew i was going to show up oh yeah the chair said the bedridden man would you mind closing the door puzzled the minister shut the door i have never told anyone this not even my daughter said the man but all of my life i have never known how to pray at church i used to hear the pastor talk about prayer but it went right over my head i abandoned any attempt at prayer the old man continued until one day about four years ago my best friend said to me johnny prayer is just a simple matter of having a conversation with jesus here is what i suggest sit down in a chair place an empty chair in front of you and in faith see jesus on the chair its not spooky because he promised ill be with you always then just speak to him in the same way youre doing with me right now so i tried it and ive liked it so much that i do it a couple of hours every day im careful though if my daughter saw me talking to an empty chair shed either have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny farm the minister was deeply moved by the story and encouraged the old man to continue on the journey then he prayed with him anointed him with oil and returned to the church two nights later the daughter called to tell the minister that her daddy had died that afternoon did he die in peace he asked yes when i left the house about two oclock he called me over to his bedside told me he loved me and kissed me on the cheek when i got back from the store an hour later i found him dead but there was something strange about his death apparently just before daddy died he leaned over and rested his head on the chair beside the bed what do you make of that the minister wiped a tear from his eye and said i wish we could all go like that just send this to four people and do not break this please prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive there is no cost but a lot of rewards i never said it would be easy i only said it would be worth it god netzero free internet access and email http www netzero net download index html,0.8902795910835266,204101
