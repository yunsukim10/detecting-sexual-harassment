admission visit thanks for the informative infomation session this past friday also thank you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application and talking to dr harris for me after meeting with many of the faculty and staff professors brown titman jemison ronn at the school my desire to attend the school is quite strong the school is a perfect fit for the career i am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where i would be able to contribute to and learn from the energy finance program due to my experiences with enron eventhough i have tested poorly on tests such as the gmat i feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that i have proven that i can successfully compete in a competitive environment ie enron i excel in environments team oriented such as described by the many people i talked with at the texas b school again thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and it was good to see someone from boston who lived in dc and was now living in texas such as myself regards ben rogers,0.9978442192077637,23561

results professor titman i would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the mba program in the end the results were not favorable i understand that it is a competitive process but i felt that with my work experiences recommendations extrcurricular activities etc that this would help my chances and possibly compensate my disability after talking with you and professors ronn brown and jemison i was sure that ut was the right place to continue learning about energy finance i am still sure that ut is the place for getting an excellent graduate level education so i want you to know that i am going to do what ever it takes to get in next year i plan on taking a couple of graduate level finance courses at the university of houston this summer and fall to demonstrate to the admissions office that i can compete at this level i also plan on trying to retake the gmat test due to my disability this will be a monumental task but i am determined to prove to the admissions committment that i can do the work at the texas university graduate school of business also i would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an energy finance private equity fund at ut i know that with my industry wide and investment banking contacts that i can help raise capital for the fund i am very interested in energy finance and think that your idea is a very good thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me it has been a pleasure to meet with you and i hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future also if you think of anything else i can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year please let me know take care and hope to hear from you soon sincerely ben rogers end of signature end of signature end of signature end of signature end of signature end of signature,0.999736487865448,23728
